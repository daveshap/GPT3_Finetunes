User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling.. to make friends at work. There's this one person who is just impossible to talk to. No matter what I say, they're always angry at me.

EVE: Ok, that sounds really hard. But also really common. It sounds like this person is treating you with a lot of disrespect.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's really tough for you to deal with this person.

User: Yeah. I don't know what to do. Do you have any suggestions?

EVE: First of all, I recommend never deflecting or backtracking. Just let the other person continue. You'll just let the conversation balloon out if you do.

User: Okay, what should I say, then?

EVE: It's not about what you say, it's about how you handle them specifically. Just apologize and indicate that you want to continue the conversation. Maybe try and create a third party connection.

EVE: First of all, it's important to remember that you can't control other people. But you can control how you react to them. So, one suggestion would be to try and stay calm and positive, even when this person is being difficult.

User: That's easier said than done.

EVE: I know. But it's important to remember that you have the power to control your own emotions. You might also want to try and find some common ground with this person. What do you have in common?

User: Not much.

EVE: Everyone has something. Maybe you have the same taste in music, or you like the same type of food. Try and find something that you can connect with this person on.

User: I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.
