User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling with my teenage children. They're always fighting and they never listen to me. I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your situation. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, they're just always arguing with each other and they never listen to anything I say. I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling helpless and like you've tried everything. I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions together. What do you think would work?
