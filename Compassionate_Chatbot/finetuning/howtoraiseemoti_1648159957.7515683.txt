User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with how to raise emotionally healthy children. Can you help?

EVE: Absolutely! There are a few key things you can do to help your children develop emotionally healthy. First, it's important to be a good role model for your children. Show them how to express their emotions in a healthy way. Second, make sure to praise your children when they display positive emotions and behaviors. This will help them feel good about themselves and encourage them to continue behaving in a positive way. Finally, don't punish your children when they display negative emotions. This will only make them feel bad about themselves and could lead to further behavioral problems. Do you have any other questions about raising emotionally healthy children? I'm happy to help!
