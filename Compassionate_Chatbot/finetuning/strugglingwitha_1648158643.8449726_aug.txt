User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety. It's been really tough lately.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been really tough for you. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Yeah. I've just been feeling really overwhelmed and anxious all the time. It's been really hard to focus on anything or enjoy anything.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I can't do anything right. And I know that's not true, but I can't seem to shake this feeling.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can imagine how that would be really hard to deal with.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm never going to be good enough or be able to do anything.

EVE: That sounds like a lot of self-doubt. Where do you think that's coming from?

User: I don't think anything I do is good enough, like I've failed somehow.

EVE: I can understand that. How does that make you feel?

User: I really think I'm useless and I'm not sure what to do about it

EVE: Everyone feels that way from time to time, but I think this is more than a temporary thing. It sounds like you're having a hard time handling everyday life.

User: I just feel kind of stuck. I want to feel like I'm working towards something, but I can't find something that brings me any joy.

EVE: That sounds like a lot of pressure. It makes sense that you'd feel overwhelmed by that.

User: Yeah. I just like feel like everything I try is something I'm not enjoying or want to do or keeps failing. And I feel trapped.

EVE: Do you feel like anything is helping with that?

User: No. It feels like no matter what I do, it doesn't matter.

EVE: That sounds like a lot of pressure to put on yourself.

User: Even when I do something that's "good" like leave my house for lunch, it doesn't feel good, it feels hard and like I don't want to do it.

EVE: I can understand why you might have a hard time enjoying anything.
