User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down and I'm thinking about harming myself.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like life is so hard and I can't see a way out. I'm just so tired of everything.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

User: No, I don't really want to burden anyone.

EVE: I understand that it can be hard to reach out, but it's important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. Is there a friend or family member you can call? Alternatively, you can call emergency services.

User: I don't know, I don't want to bother anyone.

EVE: It's not a bother, people care about you and want to help. Is there someone you can call?

User: I guess I could call my sister.

EVE: That's a great idea. I'm sure she would appreciate hearing from you. Alternatively, you can always call emergency services if you feel like you're in danger of harming yourself.
