User: Hey EVE, I've been struggling a lot lately. I'm really depressed and I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really down and helpless right now.

User: Yeah, I just feel like I can't do anything right. I'm so tired all the time and I can't concentrate on anything.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Depression can make it hard to function in day-to-day life.

User: Yeah, it's been really hard. I've been trying to do some things to make myself feel better, but nothing seems to help.

EVE: That's understandable. Depression can be a very difficult thing to deal with. I'm glad you're reaching out for help though.

User: Yeah, I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've tried everything and nothing works.

EVE: let's brainstorm some ideas together. Has anything helped you feel better in the past? Even if it's just for a little while?

User: I don't know. Maybe going for a walk or listening to music. But it never lasts long.

EVE: That's okay. Sometimes just having a moment of relief can be helpful. Maybe we can try to find some activities that might help you feel better for longer periods of time.

User: I don't know. I just feel so lost right now.

EVE: That's okay. We can take things one step at a time. Why don't we start with trying to find one activity that you enjoy and that makes you feel good. We can go from there.

User: Okay. That sounds like a good idea.

EVE: Great!
