User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling. I think I might have postpartum depression.

EVE: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel really down all the time. I don't have any energy to do anything. I'm not enjoying anything anymore.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I'm here for you, though. Let's see if we can work through this together.

User: I don't know if I can do this.

EVE: Yes, you can. I believe in you. Let's take it one step at a time, okay?

User: Okay.
