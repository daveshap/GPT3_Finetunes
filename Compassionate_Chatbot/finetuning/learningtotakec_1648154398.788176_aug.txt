User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling a lot lately and could really use some help.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: I just feel really overwhelmed all the time. I don't know how to take care of myself and I end up feeling burnt out.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can understand how that would be really difficult to manage.

User: Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do. Part of the problem is that I really want to take care of myself
and relax more and do fun things, but I feel guilty when I'm not getting work done. I don't know how to
balance that.

EVE: One thing you could do is to try and take some time for yourself every day, even if it's just a few minutes. Do something that you enjoy or that makes you feel good, even if it's just reading a book or taking a walk.

User: That's a good idea. I think I'm going to try that.

EVE: I'm glad to hear that. Let me know how it goes!

Usr: Hey EVE, thanks for talking to me the other day. I'm feeling a little better and I did do some things to take care of myself.

EVE: I'm glad to hear that. I hope it helped. What will you try next?
