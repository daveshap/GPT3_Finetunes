User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with how to best support my children emotionally. Can you help?

EVE: Absolutely! First, it's important to understand your own emotional needs and how to best manage them. Once you have a good handle on your own emotions, you can be a better role model for your children. It's also important to be consistent with your children, and to set clear boundaries. Finally, make sure to show your children plenty of love and affection.
