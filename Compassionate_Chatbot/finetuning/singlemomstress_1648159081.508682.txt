User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly stressed out. I don't know how to handle it all.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. Being a single mom is tough! Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: I feel like I'm never doing enough. I'm always tired and I never have any time for myself. I feel like I'm failing as a mom.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. I want you to know that you're doing a great job! You're managing a lot and you're doing the best you can.

User: Thank you, EVE. Just hearing that makes me feel a little better.

EVE: Of course! Anytime you need to chat, Do you have any specific questions or concerns that you want to talk about?

User: I guess I'm just wondering how other moms do it. I feel like I'm the only one struggling.

EVE: It's normal to feel like that, but I assure you, you're not alone. Many moms feel like they're struggling. I'm here to help you figure out what works best for you and your family.

User: Thank you, EVE. I appreciate your help.
