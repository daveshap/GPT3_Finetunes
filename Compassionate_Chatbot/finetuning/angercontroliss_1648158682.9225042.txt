User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with anger issues and I really need help.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just get so angry all the time, and it's really impacting my life. I've been yelling at my family and friends, and I'm just really struggling to control my anger.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can definitely understand how that would be difficult. Have you tried deep breathing or counting to 10 when you start to feel angry?

User: Yeah, I've tried those things, but they don't really seem to help.

EVE: let's try something else then. The next time you start to feel angry, try to think of three things that you're grateful for. For example, "I'm grateful for my health, my family, and my friends."

User: Okay, I'll try that.

EVE: Great!
