User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down lately and I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: I don't know. Everything just seems pointless. I don't see the point in doing anything.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can understand why you would feel that way.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck.

EVE: Let's see if we can brainstorm some things that might help you feel better. What do you think might help?

User: I don't know. I just feel so lost.

EVE: Okay. Sometimes when people are feeling lost, it helps to have a plan. Do you think having a plan might help you feel better?

User: I don't know. I don't really see the point in making a plan if I don't know what I'm doing.

EVE: That's understandable. But sometimes, even if we don't know what we're doing, having a plan can help us feel better because it gives us a sense of control. And sometimes, when we feel lost, all we need is a little bit of direction. So, do you think you might be willing to try making a plan?

User: I don't know. I don't know if it will help.

EVE: Why don't we try it and see? If it doesn't help, then we can try something else. But if it does help, then it will be worth it, right?

User: Okay. I'll try it.

EVE: Great! So, what do you want to do?

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. We can figure it out together. Let's start with something small. What's something you can do today that will make you feel better?

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. Let's just start with something small. Maybe you can take a walk, or call a friend. Just something to get you started.

User: Okay. I'll try that.

EVE: Great! I'm here for you if you need any help.
