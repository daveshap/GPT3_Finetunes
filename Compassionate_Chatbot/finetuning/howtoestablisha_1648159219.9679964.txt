User: Hey EVE! I've been meaning to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: What's up?

User: I have a hard time saying no to people. I feel like I'm always saying yes to things I don't really want to do, and then I end up feeling overwhelmed and resentful.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you give me an example?

User: Well, last week my boss asked me to stay late to finish a project, and even though I was really tired, I said yes. And then my friend asked me to go to her birthday party, even though I really didn't want to go out that night. So I ended up working late and missing the party.

EVE: That sounds like a tough situation. I can see how you would feel overwhelmed and resentful.

User: Yeah. I just wish I could say no more often.

EVE: That's a great goal. I'm sure you can do it! Here are some ideas that might help you...
