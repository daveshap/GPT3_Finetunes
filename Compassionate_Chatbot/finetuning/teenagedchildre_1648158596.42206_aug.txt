User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling with my teenage children. They're always fighting and they never listen to me. I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your situation. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, they're just always arguing with each other and they never listen to anything I say. I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling helpless and like you've tried everything. I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions together. What do you think would work?

User: That sounds great, maybe we can go over some strategies.

EVE: Let's do it. First, we need to figure out the problem. It sounds like they're not listening to you or each other. What do you think is the root of their problem?

User: I honestly have no idea.

EVE: What do they argue about?
