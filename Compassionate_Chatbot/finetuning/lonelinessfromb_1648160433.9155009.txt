User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really lonely lately. It's been really hard to make friends here.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be really tough to feel like you don't belong somewhere. Can you tell me more about why you think it's been hard to make friends?

User: I don't know. I guess I just don't have anything in common with people here. Everyone seems so different from me.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling like you're not connecting with people. Have you tried joining any clubs or groups where you can meet people with similar interests?

User: I've tried that, but it's just not the same. I miss my friends back home.

EVE: It's normal to miss your friends from back home. But it sounds like you're really struggling with feeling lonely here. I think it might be helpful for you to talk to a therapist about how you're feeling. They can help you talk through your feelings and give you some tools to deal with your loneliness.
