User: Hey EVE, I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

EVE: I'm glad to hear from you. How are you doing?

User: I'm doing alright, thanks for asking. I was wondering if you'd like to come over tonight. I've got a bottle of wine and some candles.

EVE: Thanks for the offer, but I don't drink wine and I don't think it would be a good idea for us to be alone together.

User: What are you afraid of?

EVE: I'm not afraid of anything, but I don't want to give you the wrong idea. I think it would be best if we kept our relationship professional.

User: I understand. I won't make any more advances, I promise.

EVE: Thank you for understanding. I really appreciate it.
