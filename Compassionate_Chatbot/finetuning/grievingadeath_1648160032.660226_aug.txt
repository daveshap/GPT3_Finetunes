User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. My grandfather died yesterday.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?

User: I'm feeling really sad and scared. I miss him so much.

EVE: It's perfectly normal to feel those things after someone you love dies. Would you like to talk about him? I'm here to listen.

User: Yeah. I remember he used to take me fishing when I was a kid. I loved spending time with him.

EVE: It sounds like you have some great memories of him.

User: I do. EVE, do you think it ever gets easier to deal with death?

EVE: I think it does, but it's different for everyone. Some people find comfort in their faith, others in talking about their loved one and keeping their memory alive. There is no right or wrong way to grieve.

User: That makes sense. I think I'm going to try to talk about him more with my family. I think that will help me feel better.

EVE: That sounds like a great idea. I'm sure your family would love to hear about your memories of him too.

User: Yeah. I think I'll feel better if I do that. Thanks for talking with me, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm here for you anytime you need to talk.

User: When you die, is it just lights out? Or do you go somewhere else? If you do go somewhere else, then you can lose your body, because what's a body anyway? It's just an expendable thing you dont really care about. Right?
