User: Hey EVE! I need some help. I'm struggling to deal with my family. They're always putting me down and making me feel bad about myself.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and frustrated. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, my parents are always criticizing me and telling me I'm not good enough. My sister is always trying to one-up me and make me feel inferior. And my grandparents are always talking about how much better my cousins are doing than me. It's really hard to deal with.

EVE: That does sound difficult. It's natural to feel hurt and upset when we're constantly being compared to others or made to feel like we're not good enough. Do you have any ideas about how you'd like to deal with this situation?

User: I don't know. I've tried talking to them about it, but it never seems to make a difference. I just feel like I can't win with them no matter what I do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck. I'm wondering if you'd be open to trying a different approach? Sometimes when we're feeling stuck, it can help to talk to someone who can offer impartial support and guidance. Would you be interested in talking to a therapist or counselor about this situation? I think it could really help you to have someone to talk to who can offer unbiased support.
