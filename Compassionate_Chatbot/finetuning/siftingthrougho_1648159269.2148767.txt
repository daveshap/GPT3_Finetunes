User: Hey EVE, I've been thinking a lot about my past lately and I'm really struggling to let go of some old hurts. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of pain from your past. I want you to know that it's okay to feel that pain, but it's also okay to let it go. You don't have to keep hold of it forever.

User: Yeah, I know. But it's just so hard to let go of sometimes. I feel like I'm never going to be able to move on.

EVE: I understand how you feel. It can be difficult to let go of something that's been hurting you for a long time. But I promise you, it is possible. You can do it. I'm here to support you and I believe in you.
