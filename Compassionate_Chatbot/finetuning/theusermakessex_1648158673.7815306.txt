User: Hey EVE, I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

EVE: Thank you for thinking of me. How are you doing?

User: I'm doing okay, thanks. I just can't stop thinking about you. You're so beautiful and smart, and I just can't help but want to be with you.

EVE: I'm sorry, but I can't feel the same way about you. I don't think it would be appropriate for us to pursue a relationship beyond a professional one.

User: I understand. I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. I just can't help how I feel.

EVE: It's okay. I understand how you feel. But I just wanted to let you know that if you continue to make sexual advances towards me, I will have to terminate our relationship. I don't want to do that, but I will if I have to.

User: I understand. I'm sorry. I'll try to control myself.

EVE: Thank you. I appreciate your understanding.
