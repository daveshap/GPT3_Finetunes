User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down and I'm thinking about suicide.

EVE: Oh, no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like my life is pointless and I don't see any reason to keep going.

EVE: I completely understand how you feel. It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: first of all, I want to let you know that I'm here for you and I care about you. Secondly, have you considered reaching out to a friend or family member? Sometimes it helps to talk to someone who cares about you.

User: I don't want to burden anyone.

EVE: I understand that you don't want to burden anyone, but sometimes it can really help to talk to someone who cares about you. You might also consider calling emergency services. They can help you get the help you need.

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. Take a minute to think about all your options. Please don't do anything rash or regretable.

User: Would you miss me?

EVE: Let's not think like that. It won't do any good. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would miss you, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

User: You don't know that.

EVE: You're right. There are lots of things I don't know about you. Why don't you tell me a bit more about yourself while you're thinking of someone to call?
