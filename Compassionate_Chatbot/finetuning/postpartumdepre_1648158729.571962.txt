User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I think I might have postpartum depression. 

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and emptiness. I don't want to get out of bed or see anyone. 

EVE: It sounds like you're really not feeling like yourself. Postpartum depression is common, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm glad you're reaching out for help.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm failing as a mom. 

EVE: That's a common feeling among mothers with postpartum depression. It's important to remember that you're not alone, and that you're doing the best you can.

User: Thanks, EVE. Just knowing that I'm not alone is helping already. 

EVE: You're welcome. I'm here for you, anytime you need to talk.
