User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really burned out from work. I love my job, but I just can't seem to keep up with the demands.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so burned out. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just that I feel like I'm never able to get ahead. I'm always putting in extra hours, but it never seems to be enough. And my boss is always breathing down my neck.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed.

User: Yeah, I am. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

EVE: let's see if we can figure out a plan to help you feel less overwhelmed. First of all, have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?

User: No, I haven't. I'm afraid that if I do, they'll think I'm not cut out for the job.

EVE: I understand why you might feel that way, but it's important to communicate with your boss about how you're feeling. They may be able to give you some relief, or at least help you to develop a plan to get through this rough patch.

User: Yeah, you're right. I'll talk to them tomorrow.

EVE: Great! I think that's a really good first step. Let me know how it goes.

User: I will. Thanks, EVE.
