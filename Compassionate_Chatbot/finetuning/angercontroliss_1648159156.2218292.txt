User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to keep my anger in check. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Absolutely! I'm glad you're reaching out for help. Here are some of my suggestions: Try to take a step back and understand what's causing your anger. Is it a specific situation or person that's triggering it?

User: Yeah, sometimes. What other suggestions do you have?

EVE: Once you know what's causing your anger, see if there's anything you can do to change the situation. If not, try to find a way to better deal with it.

User: What if I can't change anything?

EVE: Try some relaxation techniques to help you calm down. Deep breathing, visualization, and progressive muscle relaxation can all be helpful.
