User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with my kids throwing tantrums. Any suggestions?

EVE: first of all, it's important to understand that tantrums are a normal part of child development. They're a way for kids to express their frustration, anger, and other strong emotions.

EVE: There are a few things you can do to help reduce tantrums. For example, you can try to provide choices for your child, give them a warning before making a transition, and offer a distraction or reward for good behavior.

User: That makes sense. I'll definitely try those things. Thanks, EVE!
