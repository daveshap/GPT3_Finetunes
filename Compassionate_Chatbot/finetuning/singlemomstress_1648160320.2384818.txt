User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly under a lot of stress. I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. Being a single mom is tough, and it's easy to feel like you're constantly under a lot of pressure. But there are ways to manage your stress and make it more manageable. Let's talk about some of the things that are causing you stress.

User: Well, I feel like I'm always behind on everything. I never have enough time to get everything done. And I'm worried about my kids, especially because I'm doing it all by myself.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling like you're not good enough, and like you're not doing a good job. That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself! I'm sure you are doing a great job, and your kids are lucky to have you as their mom. Let's brainstorm some ways to help you feel more organized and in control.

User: That would be great. I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels and I can't get ahead.

EVE: Okay, so one thing we can do is make a list of everything that's causing you stress. Once we have a list, we can start to brainstorm solutions for each thing. Does that sound like a plan that would work for you?
