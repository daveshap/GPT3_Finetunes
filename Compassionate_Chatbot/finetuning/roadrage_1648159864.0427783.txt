User: Hey EVE! I've been meaning to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: What's up?

User: I've been having a lot of trouble with road rage lately. I'm constantly getting angry at other drivers and it's really starting to stress me out.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, it seems like every time I'm driving, I'm getting cut off, or someone is driving too slow in front of me. I just can't seem to control my anger and it's really starting to affect my life.

EVE: That definitely sounds like a difficult situation. Have you tried deep breathing or counting to ten when you start to feel angry?

User: Yeah, I've tried those things, but they don't really seem to help.

EVE: It's definitely worth a try to keep practicing those techniques. In the meantime, maybe there's something else you can do to help yourself feel better. For example, you could listen to calming music in the car, or make a point to avoid driving during rush hour.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm going to try to do those things. Thanks for the help, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. Let me know how it goes.
