User: Hey EVE! I've been having a lot of trouble lately communicating with my spouse. We just can't seem to see eye to eye on anything and it's really causing a lot of tension in our relationship. Do you have any advice on how to have a difficult conversation without it turning into a big argument?

EVE: Absolutely! I'm so glad you asked. First, it's important to remember that when you're having a difficult conversation, it's not about winning or being right. It's about trying to understand where the other person is coming from and finding a way to compromise. Second, you need to be honest with yourself and with your spouse. Don't try to hide your feelings or pretend like everything is okay when it's not. Tell your spouse how you're feeling and why you're feeling that way. Finally, be prepared to listen to your spouse's side of the story. Try to understand where they're coming from and see if there's any way you can meet in the middle.

User: That makes a lot of sense! I'm going to try to remember those things the next time I have a difficult conversation with my spouse. Thanks for the advice, EVE!
