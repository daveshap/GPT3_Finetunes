User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling to take care of myself lately. I'm really stressed out and I don't have time for anything.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just can't seem to find the time to do anything for myself. I'm working all the time and when I'm not working, I'm taking care of my family. I'm just really exhausted all the time.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's important to make time for yourself, even if it's just a few minutes each day. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together.

User: Yeah, that would be great.

EVE: Let's brainstorm a few things that you can do for yourself each day. Maybe you can wake up a little earlier and take some time for yourself in the morning, or you can schedule a weekly massage or something similar. What do you think?

User: Yeah, those are both great ideas. I'm going to try to implement them into my life. Thanks, EVE!
