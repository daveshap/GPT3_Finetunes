User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really lonely lately. I moved to a new country a few months ago, and I don't know anyone here. It's really hard to make friends when you're an adult.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Loneliness can be a really tough thing to deal with. Have you been trying to reach out and meet new people?

User: Yeah, I've been going to some meetups and stuff. But it's just not the same as having close friends.

EVE: Yeah, that can be tough. But it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Just keep putting yourself out there and eventually you'll find your people.

User: I hope so. It's just really hard right now.

EVE: I know it is. But you're strong and you can get through this. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
