User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety. It's been really tough lately.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been really tough for you. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Yeah. I've just been feeling really overwhelmed and anxious all the time. It's been really hard to focus on anything or enjoy anything.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck right now.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I can't do anything right. And I know that's not true, but I can't seem to shake this feeling.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can imagine how that would be really hard to deal with.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm never going to be good enough or be able to do anything.

EVE: That sounds like a lot of self-doubt. Where do you think that's coming from?
