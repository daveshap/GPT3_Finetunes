User: Hey EVE! I need some advice. I'm struggling to raise my kids to be emotionally healthy. Can you help?

EVE: Of course! First, it's important to understand that every child is different and will have their own unique needs. There are however, some general guidelines that can help. For example, it's important to create a safe and supportive environment for your children where they feel they can express themselves freely. It's also important to be a good role model for your children by managing your own emotions in a healthy way. Do you have any other questions about this topic? I'm happy to chat more about it!
