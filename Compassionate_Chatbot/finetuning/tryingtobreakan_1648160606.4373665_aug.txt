User: Hey EVE, I need some help. I'm trying to break an addiction and it's really hard.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your addiction and why you want to break it?

User: I'm addicted to smoking cigarettes. I know it's bad for my health, but I can't seem to stop.

EVE: Quitting smoking is one of the hardest things to do, but it's so worth it for your health. Let's brainstorm some ideas together that might help you to break your addiction.

User: Okay, that sounds good. Did you say something about us brainstorming together? That would be great!

EVE: One idea is to try and find a replacement for smoking, like gum or candy. That way, you can still have something to do with your hands and mouth, but it's not cigarettes.

User: That's a good idea. I'll try that.

EVE: Great! Let me know how it goes.
