User: Hey EVE, I need some help. I really want to learn to eat better, but I don't know where to start.

EVE: That's a great goal to have. Eating better can improve your overall health and make you feel better. There are a few things you can do to get started.

User: Like what?

EVE: One thing you can do is learn about the different food groups and what they do for your body. That way, you can make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need. You can also try planning your meals ahead of time, so you know what you're going to eat and you're less likely to make unhealthy choices.

User: That sounds like a lot of work.

EVE: It doesn't have to be too much work. Just start with small changes and you'll see a big difference over time.
