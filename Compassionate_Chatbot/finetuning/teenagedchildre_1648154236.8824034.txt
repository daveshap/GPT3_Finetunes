User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling with my teenage children. They're both so rebellious and never listen to me. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be really tough when our children don't seem to be listening. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, my daughter never cleans her room and my son is always out with his friends. I've tried talking to them, but they just don't listen.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated. Have you tried setting some clear expectations with your children? Sometimes that can help them to understand what you're looking for.

User: I have, but they just don't seem to care. I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck. Sometimes when we feel like this, it can be helpful to talk to someone else who has been through it. Do you have any friends or family members who you can talk to about this?
