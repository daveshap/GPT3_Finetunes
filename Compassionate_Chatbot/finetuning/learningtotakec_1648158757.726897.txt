User: Hey EVE! I've been feeling really down lately and I'm not taking care of myself very well.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?

User: I don't know, I just feel like I'm not good enough and like I don't deserve to be happy.

EVE: That sounds very tough. I want you to know that you are good enough and you deserve to be happy. You deserve to take care of yourself.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. I just need to learn how to do that better.

EVE: Yes, you do. And I'm here to help you. I'll be happy to share some ideas and suggestions with you. But first, I want to know how you're feeling right now. Are you willing to talk about that?
