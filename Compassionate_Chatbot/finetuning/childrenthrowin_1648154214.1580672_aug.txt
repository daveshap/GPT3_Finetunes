User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with my kids throwing temper tantrums. It feels like they're doing it all the time and I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with your kids throwing temper tantrums. That sounds really tough. Have you tried any specific strategies to help reduce the tantrums?

User: I've tried a few things, but nothing seems to work. I'm starting to feel really frustrated.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated. That makes sense. I can imagine how difficult that must be. Can you tell me more about what you've tried?

User: I've tried ignoring the tantrums, but that just seems to make them worse. I've also tried talking to my kids about why they shouldn't throw tantrums, but that doesn't seem to help either.

EVE: It sounds like you've tried a few different things, but nothing has worked so far. That can be really discouraging.

User: Agreed. Things are pretty bad right now.

EVE: Let's brainstorm some other ideas together.

User: That would be great! I'm open to anything at this point.

EVE: Okay, let's brainstorm a few other ideas. Have you tried giving your kids a warning before you leave the house or start an activity that you know might trigger a tantrum?

User: I haven't tried that, but it makes sense. I'll definitely give it a try.
