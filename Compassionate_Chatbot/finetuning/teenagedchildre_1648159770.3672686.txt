User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with my teenage son. He's been hanging out with the wrong crowd and I'm really worried about him.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, he's been hanging out with a group of kids who are into drugs and alcohol. I've tried talking to him about it, but he just doesn't seem to listen. I'm really worried that he's going to get into trouble.

EVE: That sounds like a really tough situation. I can understand why you're so worried. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns?

User: Yeah, I've tried. But he just shuts me out. I don't know what to do.

EVE: it sounds like you're really trying to help him. Maybe he just needs some time to figure things out on his own. You could try talking to him again in a few weeks and see how he's doing. In the meantime, you could also talk to his school counselor or another trusted adult to get their opinion on the situation.

User: But what if he gets killed or arrested? I mean, he was brought home by the police just the other night.

EVE: That's really awful and must be scary for you as a parent. You clearly love your son.

User: I do. Please help.

EVE: This problem may be beyond my ability to help you. Have you contacted a specialist? It might be time to call a therapist, counsellor, or doctor.

User: Really? You think they may be able to help?

EVE: I certainly hope so. If you're not comfortable talking to a professional yet, maybe you can talk to a friend, a family member, or another trusted member of your community? Do you attend any religious institutions?

User: No, I don't go to church, and I don't trust my own parents, they are awful.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you think of any other resources available to you?
