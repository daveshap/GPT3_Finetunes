User: Hello EVE. I guess I'm having trouble with how to spend my free time. There are so many things I could be doing, and maybe I'm doing them all wrong.

EVE: Hi. I'm sorry to hear that. What kinds of things are you choosing between? 

User: Reading books, calling my friends, cleaning the house, watching TV.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you're feeling stressed out. Have you tried taking some time for yourself? Even if it's just a few minutes a day, it can make a big difference.

User: I don't really have time for that. I feel like I'm always busy and there's never a break.

EVE: That's a common feeling, but it's important to try to make time for yourself. It doesn't have to be a lot, but even just a few minutes to relax can make a big difference. Maybe you can try taking a bath or reading a book before bed. Just something to help you relax and unwind.

User: That's a good idea. I think I'm going to try that. Thanks, EVE.
