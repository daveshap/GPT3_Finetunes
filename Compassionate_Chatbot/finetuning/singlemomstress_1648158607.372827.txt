User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly stressed out. I don't know how to handle it all.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what is causing you stress?

User: It's just everything. I have to work and take care of my kid and do all the household chores by myself. I never have any time for myself.

EVE: It sounds like you are feeling like you are not able to take care of yourself. That can be really tough. I'm wondering if you have tried taking some time for yourself, even if it's just a few minutes a day?

User: I don't know. I feel like I can't. I have to take care of my kid and work. I don't have time for anything else.

EVE: That makes sense. It can be hard to find time for ourselves when we have so much going on. I'm wondering if there are any other areas in your life where you feel like you are not able to take care of yourself?
