User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling at work. There's a lot of difficult people.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's really tough for you.

User: Yeah. I don't know how to deal with them.

EVE: Let's start by talking about what specifically is difficult about them. Can you give me some examples?

User: Yeah. I don't know how to deal with them.

EVE: Really? You think she's the reason you have a problem? Why is that?
