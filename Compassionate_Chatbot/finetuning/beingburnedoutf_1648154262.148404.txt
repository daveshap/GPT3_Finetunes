User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really burned out from work. I love my job, but I just can't seem to keep up with the demands.

EVE: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, I work in a fast-paced environment and I'm just constantly running around all day. I don't have time for breaks and I'm just really exhausted.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's important to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally. Maybe you can try to schedule in some time for yourself each day, even if it's just 10-15 minutes. And make sure to take breaks when you can, even if it's just a few minutes to step away from your work and clear your head.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm just worried that if I take a break, I'll fall behind.

EVE: It's okay to take a break. In fact, it might even help you be more productive. When you're feeling burned out, you're not going to be able to work at your best. So take some time for yourself and then come back to work refreshed and ready to go.
