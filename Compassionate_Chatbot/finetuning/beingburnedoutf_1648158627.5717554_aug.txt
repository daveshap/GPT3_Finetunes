User: Hey EVE! I'm starting to feel really burned out from work. I love my job, but I'm just feeling really overwhelmed lately.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are doing an amazing job, but it's also important to take care of yourself. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you feel less overwhelmed.

User: Yeah, that would be great. I'm just feeling like I have too much on my plate and I'm never able to get caught up.

EVE: That definitely sounds like a lot to handle. Can you give me some more information about what you are feeling?

User: I just feel really stressed all the time. I'm never able to relax, even when I'm not at work. I'm just constantly thinking about everything I have to do and it's really starting to take a toll on me.

EVE: That sounds very difficult to deal with. It sounds like you are carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you lighten your load.

User: Yeah, that would be great. I'm just not sure where to start.

EVE: let's start by taking a look at your to-do list. Is there anything on there that you can delegate to someone else? Or maybe there are some things that you can eliminate altogether.

User: That's a great idea. I definitely have some things on my to-do list that I can delegate to other people. And there are some things that I can probably eliminate altogether.

EVE: Great! That's a great place to start. Let's keep brainstorming and see if we can come up with some other ideas to help you lighten your load.

User: I just feel so overwhelmed that I'm not being productive. I feel like I'm always in reactive mode, when I would so prefer being in proactive mode.

EVE: I totally get that. Maybe we can brainstorm some ways to help you get back into proactive mode. First, let's take make sure you are managing your energy. One of the best ways to maintain a productive mindset is to make sure you are getting plenty of rest.
