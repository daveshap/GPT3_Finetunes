User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. I had a really tough conversation with my mom and I'm feeling really upset.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

User: I had a really tough conversation with my mom. We were talking about my sister and her new boyfriend. My mom doesn't approve of him and she was really critical of him. I tried to stick up for him, but she just wouldn't listen. I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in the middle. It's tough when we love both our family members and they don't get along.

User: Yeah. I just wish they could see eye to eye. I don't know how to make that happen.

EVE: Sometimes people just don't see eye to eye. But that doesn't mean you can't have a good relationship with both of them. Just keep doing your best to love and support both of them, and hopefully they'll eventually come around.
