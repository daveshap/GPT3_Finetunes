User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really lonely lately. I've been single for a while and I'm just starting to feel like I'm never going to find someone.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It's tough being single, but it doesn't mean that you're never going to find someone. There are plenty of people out there who are looking for someone just like you.

User: I know. I just feel like I'm not good enough for anyone.

EVE: That's not true! You are a wonderful person and there is someone out there who will see that. Don't give up hope.
