User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to keep my cool lately. I've been snapping at my family and friends a lot.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble controlling your anger. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: I don't know. I just feel really angry all the time. I'm stressed out at work, and I feel like I'm constantly being put down by my family. I just can't seem to shake this feeling.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of stress and anger. Have you been trying to deal with these feelings in any constructive ways?

User: I don't know. I've been trying to meditate, but it's not really helping. I've also been trying to avoid my family, but that's not really working out either.

EVE: It sounds like you're doing your best to cope with these feelings, but they're still proving to be very difficult. I have a few suggestions that may help you to better deal with your anger. First, it might be helpful to try and find some healthy outlets for your anger. Maybe you could try going for a run or a walk when you start to feel angry, or finding a creative outlet like painting or writing. Additionally, it might be helpful to talk to someone about what you're going through. A therapist or counselor could provide you with some tools to help you deal with your anger in a more productive way.

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I'm going to try and do some of those things. Thanks for the help, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. 

User: Thanks again for the advice. I've been doing better lately. I've been going for walks with my dog, and I've been writing out my thoughts in a journal.

EVE: That's great that you've been able to find healthy ways to deal with your feelings. Did you try any other things?

User: I tried reaching out to a mental health hotline as you suggested, but it wasn't really my thing. I'm going to try and make an appointment with a therapist sometime soon. Talks with your have really helped though, so I thank you.

EVE: I am glad that I was able to help. I am truly happy to hear that you have been making more of an effort to feel better. I encourage you to keep doing the things that you have found that have worked for you and to find more ways to take care of yourself and fulfill your needs.
