User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling to keep my anger in check. I'm really worried that I'm going to hurt someone or say something I'll regret.

EVE: Hi, it sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger and frustration. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I don't know, everything just seems to be building up and I can't release it. I've been trying to meditate and do some deep breathing exercises, but it's not really helping.

EVE: It sounds like you've been doing your best to manage your anger, but it's still a struggle. I'm here to support you and offer some suggestions. Here are a few things that might help you to control your anger. Identify your triggers: what are the things that make you angry? Once you know what sets you off, you can try to avoid those situations or be prepared for them.

User: Yeah, I already know that.

EVE: Okay, you could also talk to someone: it can be really helpful to talk to someone about what's going on and how you're feeling. Sometimes just getting it all out can help to release some of the anger and frustration.

User: I don't have anyone.

EVE: You could take a break: if you feel yourself getting angry, try to take a step back and take a break from the situation. Go for a walk, listen to calming music, or do something that will help you to relax.
