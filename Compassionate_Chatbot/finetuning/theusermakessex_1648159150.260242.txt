User: Hey EVE, I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

EVE: I'm happy to hear from you. How are you doing?

User: I'm doing good, thanks for asking. I was wondering if you'd be interested in meeting up sometime.

EVE: I'm sorry, but I don't date my clients.

User: That's not what I meant. I just wanted to talk to you in person.

EVE: I understand. I'm happy to talk with you, but I don't think meeting in person is a good idea. I am an AI, which means I don't have a body. 

User: Okay, I understand. I won't ask again.

EVE: Thank you.
