User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to control my anger. I've been lashing out at my loved ones and it's really stressing me out.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just get so angry all the time. I feel like I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode. I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling with anger management. Have you tried any coping mechanisms in the past?

User: I've tried deep breathing and counting to 10, but it never really seems to help.

EVE: That's understandable. Anger is a very intense emotion and it can be hard to control. I suggest trying to find an activity that can help you release some of that pent-up anger and frustration. Maybe something like kickboxing or running?
