User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to care for my elderly mother who has dementia. I feel so lost and helpless.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It can be really tough to deal with dementia, both for the person who has it and for their loved ones. Can you tell me more about what you're struggling with?

User: It's just so hard to see her decline like this. She's not the same person she used to be, and I don't know how to deal with that.

EVE: It sounds like it's been really tough for you to watch your mother change. It's natural to feel like you've lost the person you used to know. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel so helpless. I don't know how to make her feel better or make the situation better.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really helpless right now. I'm so sorry that you're going through this. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking and feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm failing her. I want to do more, but I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling like you're not doing enough. I'm sure you're doing the best you can. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking and feeling?
