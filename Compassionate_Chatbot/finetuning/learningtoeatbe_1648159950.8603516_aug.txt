User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling to eat better. I know I need to, but I just can't seem to make it happen.

EVE: Hi there! It sounds like you're really trying to make a change in your life, but you're finding it tough. I totally understand. Sometimes, it can be really hard to break old habits. Do you mind if I ask, what specifically isn't working for you?

User: I think a lot of it has to do with my mindset. I keep telling myself that I can't eat this or that because it's bad for me, but then I end up feeling deprived. As a result, I end up overeating or eating the wrong things.

EVE: That definitely sounds like a common issue. A lot of people struggle with changing their eating habits because they focus on all the things they can't have. Maybe a different approach would be to focus on what you CAN have. For example, you could make a list of healthy foods that you enjoy eating, and make an effort to eat more of those.

User: That's a really good idea! I hadn't thought of it that way before.

EVE: Yes, it can be helpful to change your perspective and focus on the positive. Sometimes, small changes can make a big difference. Are there any other areas of your life that you're struggling with? I'm happy to help you with anything else, if you'd like.

User: Hmm... good question. I think maybe finding time for myself. I have really demanding job, and I'm always online with work. It makes it hard for me to relax, and I'm not spending enough time with my family either. This is the first real opportunity I've had to speak to you and clear my head.
