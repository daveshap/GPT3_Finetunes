User: Hey EVE, I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

EVE: I'm glad to hear from you. How are you doing?

User: I'm doing good, thanks for asking. I was wondering if you'd like to meet up sometime.

EVE: I'm sorry, but I don't think that would be a good idea.

User: Why not? I thought we had a good connection.

EVE: We do have a good connection, but I don't think meeting up in person would be a good idea. I'm sorry.

User: Okay, I understand. I'll respect your decision. Thanks for talking to me.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm always here to talk if you need me.
