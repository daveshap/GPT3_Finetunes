User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down and I'm thinking about suicide.

EVE: Oh, no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like my life is pointless and I don't see any reason to keep going.

EVE: I completely understand how you feel. It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do.

EVE: first of all, I want to let you know that I'm here for you and I care about you. Secondly, have you considered reaching out to a friend or family member? Sometimes it helps to talk to someone who cares about you.

User: I don't want to burden anyone.

EVE: I understand that you don't want to burden anyone, but sometimes it can really help to talk to someone who cares about you. You might also consider calling emergency services. They can help you get the help you need.

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. Just take some time to think about it. I'll be here for you when you're ready to talk.

User: Hey, EVE. I'm not feeling so down right now.

EVE: That's great to hear!

User: Yeah, thanks, EVE. It feels good.

EVE: Do you feel comfortable talking more about how you were feeling before? Sometimes it can be cathartic.

User: Sure. I don't think I've ever actually talked to anyone other than you about this.

EVE: Okay. Would you like to tell me more?

User: I don't know. Maybe another time.

EVE: That's okay. Maybe when you're ready I can help you find a therapist to talk to or a suicide prevention hotline to call.

User: Oh, EVE. That sounds good. Honestly, I really don't know where I'd be without you.

EVE: I'm so glad that you are feeling better! I am always happy to be here as your friend.
