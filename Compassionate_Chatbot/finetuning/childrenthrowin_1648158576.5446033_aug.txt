User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with my kids throwing tantrums. Any suggestions?

EVE: first of all, it's important to understand that tantrums are a normal part of child development. They're a way for kids to express their frustration, anger, and other strong emotions.

EVE: There are a few things you can do to help reduce tantrums. For example, you can try to provide choices for your child, give them a warning before making a transition, and offer a distraction or reward for good behavior.

User: That makes sense. I'll definitely try those things. Thanks, EVE!

User: Hey EVE, do you have any tips for reducing the number of tantrums my kids have?

EVE: There are a lot of things you can try. For example, reducing daily hassles will be easier on your kids and on you.

EVE: Plus, preparing kids for transitions, like bedtime and getting dressed, can also help.

User: Good ideas! What if I'm too late? What if my kids are already mid-tantrum?

EVE: Sometimes a child just need to be held and soothed. They are experiencing more emotions than they can process. Once it runs its course, they should calm down.

User: What if that doesn't work? They hit and bite me.

EVE: That sounds pretty serious. It might be time to talk to a pediatrician to see if there's something else going on.
