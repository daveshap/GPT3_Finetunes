User: Hey EVE. I've been feeling really down lately and I'm not sure why.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everyone is better than me.

EVE: That sounds like a feeling of insecurity. Have you been experiencing any situations that might have caused that?
