User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to deal with my family. They're always putting me down and making me feel bad about myself.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: They just always seem to find something to criticize me about. No matter what I do, it's never good enough for them.

EVE: That sounds really frustrating. It's hard when we feel like we can't please the people who are important to us.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. I've tried talking to them about it, but it never goes anywhere.

EVE: It sounds like you've already taken a really important step by trying to communicate with them. Have you considered trying a different approach? For example, you could try to focus on the positive things about yourself that they may not be seeing.

User: That's a good idea. I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. I'm always here if you need to talk.
