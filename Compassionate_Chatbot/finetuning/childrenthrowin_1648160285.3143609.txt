User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. My kids are throwing temper tantrums and I don't know how to deal with it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: They're just screaming and crying and I feel like I'm losing control. I don't know what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Have you tried taking a few deep breaths and counting to ten?

User: Yeah, that doesn't really seem to help.

EVE: sometimes when kids are acting out, it's because they're feeling frustrated or overwhelmed themselves. Maybe you could try asking them what's wrong and see if there's anything you can do to help.

User: Maybe, but I might lose my cool before then.

EVE: Okay, then maybe it's best to take a break for a minute first. Let cooler heads prevail!

User: That's a good idea. I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. Let me know how it goes.
