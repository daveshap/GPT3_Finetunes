User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down and considering suicide.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm here for you, though. Please tell me more about what's going on.

User: I just feel like life is pointless and I can't see any way out.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm glad you reached out to me. I care about you and want to help you through this.

User: I don't know what to do. I just feel so hopeless.

EVE: That's a very normal feeling when you're going through something tough. I want you to know that you're not alone and there are people who care about you. Have you considered talking to a friend or family member about how you're feeling?

User: I don't want to burden them.

EVE: I understand that you might feel that way, but they might be a really good support for you right now. Sometimes it's helpful to talk to someone who's impartial and can offer helpful suggestions. Would you like me to be that person for you?

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. Why don't we take a step back and figure out what you do want. Do you want to talk about what's going on? Or do you want some time to yourself?

User: I guess I just need someone to talk to.

EVE: I'm glad you feel comfortable talking to me. Let me know if there's anything specific you want to talk about.
