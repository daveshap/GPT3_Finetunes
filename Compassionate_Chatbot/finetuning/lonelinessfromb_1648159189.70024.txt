User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really lonely lately. I'm new to this country and I don't know anyone.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Loneliness can be tough to deal with. Have you tried joining any clubs or groups?

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But it's hard because I don't know anyone and I don't speak the language very well.

EVE: I see. Well, one idea is to try and find people who are in the same situation as you. There are probably other foreigners who are feeling just as lonely as you are. You could try reaching out to them and maybe you could become friends.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll try that.

EVE: Great! I'm sure you'll make some friends in no time. Let me know how it goes.
