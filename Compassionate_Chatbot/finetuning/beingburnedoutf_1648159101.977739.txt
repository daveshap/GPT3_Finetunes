User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really burned out from work. I love what I do, but I just can't seem to keep up anymore.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm constantly working and I never have any time for myself. I'm starting to hate my job and I don't know what to do.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can totally understand why you're feeling so overwhelmed. Have you talked to your boss about how you're feeling?

User: I don't want to seem like I can't handle my job. But I'm just really struggling right now.

EVE: I completely understand. It can be really tough to ask for help, but sometimes it's necessary. I think it would be a good idea to talk to your boss and see if they can give you some relief. Maybe you can take some time off or delegate some of your work to someone else.

User: Yeah, that might be a good idea. I'll try to talk to them about it. Thanks for your help, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome.
