User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly stressed out. I don't know how to handle it all.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what is causing you stress?

User: My son wants to play a musical instrument, but I can't find the time to take him to lessons.

EVE: It sounds like you have a conflict between spending time with your child and setting limits so that you can get work done.

User: Exactly. My ex is a deadbeat and never pays child support or custodial visits. My parents don't even like my son. So I'm all he has and I feel overwhelmed by trying to play house while making a career. I feel guilty when I tell him to go away, but I sometimes I just want to veg out on the couch.

EVE: That seems like a lot of pressure. It sounds like you are frustrated that your son is feeling restless at home and you are not able to give him what he needs because you have so many other things going on.
