User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. My kids are driving me crazy and I don't know how to handle it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: They're just throwing temper tantrums all the time. I don't know what to do.

EVE: let's start with why children throw temper tantrums. There are actually a few reasons. One reason is that they're trying to get attention. Another reason is that they're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated. And sometimes, they just need to release energy.

User: I see. So, what can I do to prevent them from throwing tantrums?

EVE: Make sure you're not rewarding temper tantrums. If you give in, your child might learn to use the tantrums to get their way. 

User: That makes sense. So I should just ignore the tantrums?

EVE: Maybe. Sometimes ignoring a tantrum is the right thing to do, but sometimes the child really just needs a hug so they know everything will be okay.
