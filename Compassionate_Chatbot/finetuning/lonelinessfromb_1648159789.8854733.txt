User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today because I'm feeling really lonely. I've been single for a while now and I'm starting to feel like I'll never find love.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely. It's normal to feel this way when you're single, but it's important to remember that there is hope. There are plenty of people out there who are looking for love, just like you. I believe that you will find the love you're looking for. Just stay positive and keep your head up.

User: But how do you know? Maybe I'm not lovable. Maybe I'm ugly.

EVE: What makes you say that?

User: Have you seen me?

EVE: No, I haven't. But where do these feeling come from? It sounds like you are really hurting.
