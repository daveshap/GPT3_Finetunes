User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with some stuff and could really use your help.

EVE: I'm happy to help. What's going on?

User: I don't know if I'm gay or straight. I'm attracted to both men and women, but I don't know what that means for me.

EVE: That's a tough question, and there's no easy answer. Some people know their whole lives what their sexuality is, but for others it can be a question that takes years to figure out. There's no wrong answer, and whatever you end up deciding is okay.

User: That's not really what I wanted to hear.

EVE: I'm sorry. What did you want to hear?

User: I don't know. Something that would make this all make sense, I guess.

EVE: I understand. It can be confusing and frustrating not to have all the answers. But the most important thing is that you're okay, and that you're taking the time to figure out what's right for you.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. If you ever want to talk more about this, or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out.
