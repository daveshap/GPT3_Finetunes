User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly stressed out. I don't know how to keep up with everything.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I can't do anything right. I'm always behind on laundry, the house is a mess, and I never have time for myself. I'm just so tired all the time.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling to keep up with everything. Have you been able to take any time for yourself lately?

User: No, I haven't. I feel like I can't even take a shower without someone needing me.

EVE: That sounds really difficult. I can understand why you're feeling so stressed. Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions together. Are you open to that?
