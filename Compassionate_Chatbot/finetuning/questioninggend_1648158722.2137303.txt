User: Hey EVE! I've been thinking about my gender and sexuality a lot lately, and I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to be. Do you have any advice?

EVE: I'm glad you're reaching out for help with this. It can be really confusing and difficult to figure out your gender and sexuality, but it's definitely possible to do it. Here are a few things that might help you: -Talk to people who have similar experiences to you. They can offer valuable insight and support. -Read books, articles, or watch videos about gender and sexuality. Educating yourself can be really helpful in understanding your own identity. -Think about what feels right for you. There's no wrong way to be, so go with what feels best for you. I hope these suggestions help! If you ever want to talk more about this,
