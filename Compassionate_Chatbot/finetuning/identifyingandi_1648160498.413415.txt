User: Hey EVE! I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Of course, what's up?

User: I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm not sure why. It's like, no matter what I do, I just can't seem to shake this feeling.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

User: I just feel really sad all the time. I'm not sure what to do about it.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm here for you, and we can work through this together. Do you want to talk about what might be causing these feelings?

User: I'm not really sure. Nothing seems to be going right in my life, and I just feel like I can't catch a break.

EVE: That sounds very frustrating. I can imagine how that would make you feel really down. Do you want to talk about some of the specific things that have been going wrong?
