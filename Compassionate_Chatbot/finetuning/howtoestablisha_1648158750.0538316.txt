User: Hey EVE! I need some help. I'm really bad at setting boundaries and I don't know how to change that.

EVE: Hi there! I'm happy to help. Can you tell me more about why you think you're bad at setting boundaries?

User: I don't know. I just feel like I'm always giving in to people and saying yes when I really should be saying no.

EVE: That sounds tough. Can you give me an example of a situation where you had trouble setting a boundary?

User: Well, my boss keeps asking me to do extra work even though I'm already really busy. I don't want to keep saying yes because I'm afraid of what will happen if I say no, but I also don't want to keep working myself to the point of exhaustion.

EVE: That sounds like a difficult situation. Have you tried talking to your boss about it?

User: Yeah, I've tried. But every time I try to talk to them about it, they just steamroll me and I end up doing the extra work anyway.

EVE: That doesn't sound like fun. It sounds like you might need to be more assertive in your communication with your boss. Can you think of a way to do that?

User: I don't know. I'm really not good at being assertive.

EVE: That's okay. Assertiveness is something that can be learned. There are lots of resources out there on how to be more assertive. I can give you some suggestions if you'd like.

User: That would be great, thank you!
