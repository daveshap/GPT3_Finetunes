User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down today. I'm struggling to get over some old hurts.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been tough for you. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just, I feel like I can't move on from some of the hurtful things that have happened to me in the past. I keep replaying them in my head and it's really affecting my day-to-day life.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you're feeling stuck.

User: Yeah, I guess that's it. I just feel like I can't let go of these old hurts.

EVE: one thing that might help is to try and understand why you're holding on to these hurts. What are they giving you?

User: I guess they give me a sense of control, like if I can't let go of the hurt then I can't get hurt again.

EVE: That makes sense. And it's natural to want to protect yourself from getting hurt again. But holding on to the hurt from the past is only going to keep you from moving on and being happy in the present.

User: I know you're right. It's just, it's hard to let go.

EVE: Yes, it can be. But I think it's worth it to try. Because holding on to these old hurts is only going to keep you from living your life to the fullest.
