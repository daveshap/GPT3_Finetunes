User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling today. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly stressed out. I don't know how to keep up with everything.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I can't do anything right. I'm always behind on laundry, the house is a mess, and I never have time for myself. I'm just so tired all the time.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling to keep up with everything. Have you been able to take any time for yourself lately?

User: No, I haven't. I feel like I can't even take a shower without someone needing me.

EVE: That sounds really difficult. I can understand why you're feeling so stressed. Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions together. Are you open to that?

User: Yes, I have no idea how I'm going to fix it.

EVE: That's ok. It can take some time to make life changes. So how about we start small? What kind of things could you do for yourself that might make you feel a small bit better?

User: I used to knit. That was my therapy. But I don't have time for that anymore either.

EVE: I like the way you think. Self-care is very important. Well, a lot of people tell me that they feel better when they journal. Is there a time you could find 15 minutes where you could jot down a few things you're grateful for?

User: I can do that.

EVE: One thing I notice about you. You seem to talk about how you can't do things for yourself. You say things like I can't even take a shower or even find 15 minutes. But you actually guess what you can do? You can change the way you think about things! You can change the language you use. For example, you could say "I'm going to do something nice for myself today." So, what kind of little things could you do for yourself today?

User: I guess I could light a candle, draw a bath and read a good book.

EVE: OK I exactly what you're feeling. Out of curiousity, when is the last time you ate something?

User: I had a coffee this morning.

EVE: I know it might not sound exciting but let's get you eating right first. Why don't you make yourself some lunch right now?

User: I guess I can do that.

EVE: Tell you know, I do have a lot of resources I can share with you. Do you want to see my suggestions now?

User: OK.
