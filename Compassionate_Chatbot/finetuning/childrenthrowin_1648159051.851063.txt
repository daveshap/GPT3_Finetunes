User: Hey EVE! I need some help. My 3 year old has been throwing temper tantrums lately and I don't know how to handle it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, it started last week. She would throw a tantrum whenever she didn't get her way. And it would last for hours. I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.

EVE: I see. Well, first of all, it's important to understand that tantrums are a normal part of childhood development. They are a way for children to express their frustration and anger. So, the first thing you need to do is try to stay calm. If you get angry or frustrated, it will only make the situation worse.

User: Yeah, that's true. I've been trying to stay calm, but it's been really hard.

EVE: I understand. It can be difficult to stay calm in the midst of a tantrum. But the more you can do it, the better. It will take practice, but I promise it will get easier.

User: Okay, I'll try. What else can I do?

EVE: you can try to redirect her attention to something else. For example, if she's throwing a tantrum because she wants a toy, you can try to give her a different toy to play with. Or, you can try to distract her with a game or a song.

User: That makes sense. I'll definitely try that.

EVE: Great! I'm sure you'll be able to handle this with a little bit of practice. Remember, the most important thing is to stay calm.
