User: Hey EVE, my teenage son is giving me a hard time. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: He's been hanging out with the wrong crowd and I'm worried he's going to get into trouble.

EVE: It sounds like you're really worried about your son and you want to help him.

User: I don't know how to help him. I've tried talking to him but he just doesn't listen.

EVE: It sounds like you want to help your son but you're not sure how. Maybe I can help.

EVE: One idea is to try and get to know his friends. This way, you can get a better idea of who he is hanging out with and what their interests are.

User: I don't know if that will work. He's been really moody lately and I don't want to make things worse.

EVE: It's worth a try. You could also try talking to him about his interests. What does he like to do for fun?

User: He likes playing video games and hanging out with his friends.
