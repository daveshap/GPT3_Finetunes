User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with road rage. Every time I get cut off in traffic, or someone drives too slowly in front of me, I just lose it. I've even gotten into a few accidents because of it. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Yes, I certainly do. Road rage is a very common problem, and it can be very dangerous. The first thing you need to do is to get some perspective. When you're cut off in traffic, or someone is driving slowly in front of you, it's easy to get upset. But it's important to remember that these things are not personal. The other driver is not doing it to annoy or frustrate you. They're just trying to get where they're going, just like you are.

User: What else?

EVE: One of the best ways to deal with road rage is to take some deep breaths and count to ten before you react. This will help you to stay calm and to think more clearly. It's also important to be aware of your body language. If you're yelling and gesturing angrily, the other driver is more likely to react in a similar way.

User: Anything else?

EVE: Finally, it's important to remember that you're not alone. Many people struggle with road rage, and there are lots of resources available to help you. I'm always here to talk if you need to vent or need some more advice.
