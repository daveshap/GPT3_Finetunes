User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling to deal with my family. I have a lot of difficulty communicating with them, and I don't know how to make things better.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your family and what kind of difficulty you're having?

User: Well, my parents are divorced, and I have a step-family. My step-mom is really hard to get along with, and my dad is always working. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle and I don't know how to make things better.

EVE: It sounds like it's been tough for you. Have you tried talking to your dad about how you're feeling?

User: Yeah, I've tried. But he's always working and he's really busy. I don't think he really understands what I'm going through.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really alone right now. I'm here for you, and I'm here to help. Let me know if you ever want to talk more about your family or anything else that's going on in your life.
