User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm LGBT and I can't seem to stop hiding it. I'm so tired of having to pretend to be something I'm not.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be really tough for you. Can you tell me more about why you feel like you have to hide it?

User: It's just so hard. I feel like I can't be myself around anyone. I'm afraid of what they'll think or say if they find out.

EVE: I totally understand. It can be really scary to come out and be open about who you are. But it's important to remember that you're not alone. There are millions of people who are LGBT, and many of them have gone through the same thing you're going through now.

User: I know. But it's still so hard. I don't know if I can do it.

EVE: Yes, it's definitely not easy. But I believe in you. I know you can do it. I'll be here for you, every step of the way.
