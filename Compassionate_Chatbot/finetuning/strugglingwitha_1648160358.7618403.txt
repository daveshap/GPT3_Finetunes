User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety and I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel really anxious all the time. I'm always worrying about things and I can't seem to relax.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can understand why you might feel that way. Do you want to talk about some of the things you're worried about?

User: I guess I'm just worried about screwing up. I don't want to make any mistakes.

EVE: Everyone makes mistakes, and that's okay! What's important is that you learn from them. I think you're capable of handling whatever comes your way.

User: But what if I can't? What if I fail hardcore?

EVE: I'm curious where this fear is coming from? Why do you believe that you can't?
