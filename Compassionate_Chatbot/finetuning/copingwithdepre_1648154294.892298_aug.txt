User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down lately. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I can't do anything right.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can imagine how that would feel.

User: I just feel so hopeless.

EVE: That must be so tough to feel that way. I'm here for you, and I want to help you through this. Let me give you some ideas of things that might help you feel better. First, let's talk about some things that you're doing that are going well. What are some things that you're proud of?

User: Well, I recently got a promotion at work. And I've been spending more time with my family, which has been really nice.

EVE: That's great! It sounds like you're doing a lot of things right. That's really positive. Let's focus on those things and see if we can build on them.

User: I guess you're right. It's just been hard to see the positive lately.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really down about yourself right now. That's totally normal.

User: I don't know what to say. I just feel like nothing will make it better. I just want to be like I was before, when I was happy. Why can't I get there again?
