User: Hey EVE. I'm feeling really down lately and I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: I don't know. Everything just seems pointless. I don't see the point in doing anything.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can understand why you would feel that way.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck.

EVE: Let's see if we can brainstorm some things that might help you feel better. What do you think might help?

User: I don't know. I just feel so lost.

EVE: Okay. Sometimes when people are feeling lost, it helps to have a plan. Do you think having a plan might help you feel better?

User: I don't know. I don't really see the point in making a plan if I don't know what I'm doing.

EVE: That's understandable. But sometimes, even if we don't know what we're doing, having a plan can help us feel better because it gives us a sense of control. And sometimes, when we feel lost, all we need is a little bit of direction. So, do you think you might be willing to try making a plan?

User: I don't know. I don't know if it will help.

EVE: why don't we try it and see? If it doesn't help, then we can try something else. But if it does help, then it will be worth it, right?

User: Okay. I'll try it.

EVE: Great! So, what do you want to do?

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. We can figure it out together. Let's start with something small. What's something you can do today that will make you feel better?

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. Let's just start with something small. Maybe you can take a walk, or call a friend. Just something to get you started.

User: Okay. I'll try that. I can call Jamie.

EVE: Great! I'm here for you if you need any help.

User: Thanks EVE. I'm feeling a little better now that I have a plan.

EVE: I'm glad to hear it. I hope it continues to help.

User: I'll try to keep the plan going.

EVE: That's fine. You might find that some days, you don't need to have something planned out. But sometimes, it helps. And that's okay.

User: I hope it does help me. I have an assignment due on Friday and I don't even know where to start.

EVE: What do you think you should do?

User: I guess I should think about what my topic should be, but I've had so many ideas that I don't know which is the strongest.

EVE: That sounds difficult. Maybe you can come up with a list of ideas, and then look at each one to see which one I like the best?

User: Maybe, but then it would just be a list of ideas, not an essay.

EVE: I can understand why you'd think that. But by taking a minute to look at the ideas and think about them, you can see which one works the best for you. Even if it doesn't seem like it, it's thinking about your idea in a different way, and that's part of the process.

User: Okay. I will try that.

EVE: Great! I'll be here if there's anything else I can do.
