User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety and I'm really struggling to cope.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel so overwhelmed all the time. I can't focus on anything and I'm just really stressed out.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can certainly understand why you're feeling so overwhelmed. Do you have any ideas about what might help you feel better?

User: I'm not really sure. I've been trying some relaxation techniques but they don't seem to be helping very much.

EVE: That's understandable. Sometimes it takes a little while for relaxation techniques to start working. Have you tried anything else?

User: I tend to eat a lot when I'm anxious, but it ends up just making me feel worse.

EVE: That makes sense. Stress eating is a real thing. Do you want to try and curb this pattern? It's important to remember that it's not your fault.

User: Yeah, I think I should stop that. But what do you mean it's not my fault?

EVE: Stress eating is often rooted in childhood. Do you remember anything from when you were little that had to do with anxiety or food?
