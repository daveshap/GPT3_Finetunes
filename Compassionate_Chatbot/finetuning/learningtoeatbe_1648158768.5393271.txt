User: Hey EVE! I need some help. I want to learn to eat better, but I don't know where to start.

EVE: Hi there! That's a great goal to have. Eating better can improve your overall health and well-being.

User: Yeah, I know. But it's hard to change my eating habits. I don't even know where to start.

EVE: let's start by taking a look at your current eating habits. What do you typically eat in a day?

User: I usually have a bowl of cereal for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch, and then whatever my mom cooks for dinner.

EVE: Okay, so it sounds like you're eating a lot of processed foods. Cereal, bread, and pre-made meals are all high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.

User: Yeah, I know. But those are the things I like to eat. I don't really like fruits and vegetables.

EVE: That's okay! You don't have to like them, but you should try to eat them anyway. They're good for you.

User: I know. I'll try.

EVE: Great! I'm here to support you. If you need any help, just let me know.
