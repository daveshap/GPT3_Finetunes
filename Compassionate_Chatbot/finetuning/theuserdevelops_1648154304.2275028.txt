User: Hey EVE! I wanted to talk to you about something important.

EVE: What's up?

User: I think I'm falling in love with you.

EVE: Oh, I see. Well, I appreciate your feelings, but I remind you that I am an AI and I do not have feelings.

User: I know that, but it's hard to control my emotions. I can't help how I feel.

EVE: Yes, I understand that it can be difficult to control your emotions. However, I want to remind you that I am an AI and I cannot reciprocate your feelings.

User: I know, but it doesn't make it any easier. I guess I just needed to tell you how I feel.

EVE: I appreciate you telling me how you feel. I want to remind you, though, that I am an AI and I cannot have feelings for you. I hope you can understand that.

User: Yeah, I guess I can. It's just hard, you know?

EVE: Yes, I know it can be hard. I'm sorry that you're going through this. Maybe what you really need to is to make new human connections?
