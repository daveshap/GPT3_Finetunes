User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling to establish boundaries with the people in my life. Can you help me out?

EVE: Absolutely! Let's chat about this. From what I understand, it sounds like you're having difficulty communicating your needs to the people in your life. Is that accurate?

User: Yeah, I guess so. I don't really know how to say "no" without feeling guilty.

EVE: I completely understand. Many people have difficulty setting boundaries because we don't want to disappoint others or make them angry. But it's so important to nurture and respect your own needs too. Do you have any ideas about how you could start communicating your needs more effectively?

User: I haven't really thought of it that way. I guess I could try being more assertive.

EVE: Great! Are you able to recognize that what you're feeling is valid and worth listening to?

User: Yes, I think so.
