User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down lately and I'm thinking about harming myself.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm a failure and like everyone would be better off without me.

EVE: That doesn't sound like a very positive way of thinking. Have you tried talking to a friend or family member about how you're feeling?

User: No, I don't want to burden them.

EVE: I understand that you might not want to burden them, but it's important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. Maybe they can offer some support or help you see things in a different light. If you don't feel comfortable talking to a friend or family member, you can always call a crisis line.

User: I don't know, EVE. I'm just so tired of everything.

EVE: I can understand how you're feeling. It sounds like you're feeling pretty hopeless right now. But it's important to remember that things can and will get better. If you're feeling like you can't continue on, please call a friend, family member, or emergency services. They can help you get through this tough time.
