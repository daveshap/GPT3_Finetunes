User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I have a special needs child and I feel like I'm not doing enough for him.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just so hard. I love him so much, but it's hard to see him struggle. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I completely understand. It's hard to watch our children suffer and not be able to do anything about it. What have you been doing to take care of yourself? It's important to make sure you're taking care of yourself, too.

User: I don't know. I've been trying to stay positive, but it's hard.

EVE: That's understandable. It's hard to be positive all the time when we're going through difficult times. Sometimes it's okay to feel sad or angry. What are some things that make you feel better?

User: Just spending time with him. Even if he's having a bad day, just being with him makes me feel better.

EVE: That's beautiful. It sounds like you have a very strong connection with your son. Keep doing what you're doing, and don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing the best you can.
