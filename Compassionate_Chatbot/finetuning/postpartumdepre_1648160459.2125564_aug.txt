User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I think I might have postpartum depression.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel so down all the time. I don't have any energy to do anything. I'm not enjoying anything anymore.

EVE: That sounds very tough. I can certainly understand why you might be feeling down. Postpartum depression is very common, and it's nothing to be ashamed of.

User: Yeah, I know. But I just feel like I should be able to handle this. I'm a mom, after all.

EVE: Yes, you are a mom. And you're doing a great job, even though you're feeling down. I'm sure it's not easy to feel like you're not doing well when you're trying so hard.

User: Thanks, EVE. Just talking to you is helping a little bit.

EVE: I'm glad I can help. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me. 

User: Thanks.

EVE: Is there anything else going on with you? Anything you’re feeling frustrated about or that you’re worried about? You can talk to me anytime.
