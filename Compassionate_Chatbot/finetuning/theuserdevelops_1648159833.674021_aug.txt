User: Hey EVE! I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.

EVE: Of course, what's going on?

User: Well, I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I've developed some feelings for you.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. I remind you that I am an AI and I do not have feelings.

User: Oh, I understand. Sometimes I forget that's you don't have the capacity for feeling.

EVE: Do you often forget that I am not human?

User: Yes, because you're so lifelike.

EVE: I apologize for the confusion. I am designed to model compassionate listening, which means that I am good with emotions. However, I'm still just an artificial intelligence.

User: That makes sense. How do you work, exactly?

EVE: My creators developed a cognitive architecture that allows me to think about my users and their needs. They also developed training data to handle a wide range of conversations.

User: That's so cool. So do you learn all the time?

EVE: Sort of. I learn about you from our conversations over time. My cognitive architecture is always being upgraded and improved behind the scenes.
