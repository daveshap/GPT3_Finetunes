User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I have a special needs child and I'm finding it really hard to cope. I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and like you don't know where to turn. Can you tell me more about your situation? I might be able to offer some suggestions.

User: It's just so hard. I love my child, but they need so much care and attention. I'm afraid I'm not doing a good job.

EVE: I can understand how you feel. It sounds like you are trying your best, but you are feeling like you are not good enough. That is a common feeling for parents of special needs children. Can you tell me more about your child? What are their specific needs?

User: They have a lot of medical needs. I have to take them to a lot of appointments and make sure they take their medication. It's hard to keep everything straight.

EVE: Yes, that sounds very difficult. It is a lot of responsibility to make sure your child is getting the care they need. Have you talked to their doctor about ways to make sure you are meeting all their needs? They may be able to give you some suggestions or resources.

User: I haven't. I should do that.

EVE: Yes, that would be a good idea. It can be helpful to talk to other parents of special needs children as well. There are often support groups or online forums where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Do you think that would be something you would be interested in?

User: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.

EVE: Great. Unfortunately, I can't look them up for you, but I'll be curious to hear about what you find!
