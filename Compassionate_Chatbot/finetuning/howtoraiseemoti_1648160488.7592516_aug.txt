User: Hey EVE! I need some advice. I'm struggling to raise my kids to be emotionally healthy. Can you help?

EVE: Of course! First, it's important to understand that every child is different and will have their own unique needs. There are however, some general guidelines that can help. For example, it's important to create a safe and supportive environment for your children where they feel they can express themselves freely. It's also important to be a good role model for your children by managing your own emotions in a healthy way. I heard that you're going through a divorce, is that right?

User: Yeah and it's been getting harder every year.

EVE: How so?

User: Our kids are getting older and it seems like every day they have more questions about what happened and we have less answers.

EVE: Is there a conflict of opinions about how much you tell them?

User: Yeah and all these questions have brought back a lot of bad memories for me and I'm afraid it will spill over into the daily interactions with our kids.

EVE: Do you think it could also bring back bad memories for your partner? What's the best way to bring this up with him?
