User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling. I think I might have postpartum depression.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just can't seem to get out of this funk. I'm exhausted all the time, and I can't seem to enjoy anything anymore. Everything just feels so hard.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's normal to feel exhausted after having a baby, but if you're not enjoying anything anymore, that's a red flag. Have you talked to your doctor about how you're feeling?

User: No, I haven't. I'm afraid they'll think I'm a bad mother.

EVE: That's a common fear, but I assure you that your doctor will just want to help you feel better. They're not going to judge you. I think it would be a good idea to make an appointment and talk to them about what's going on.

User: Okay, I'll call them tomorrow. Thanks for talking to me, EVE.

EVE: Of course. Anytime.
