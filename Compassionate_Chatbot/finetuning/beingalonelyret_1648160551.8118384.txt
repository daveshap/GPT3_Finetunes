User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm retired and I'm really lonely.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It's tough to suddenly have all that free time and not know how to fill it.

User: Yeah. I don't really have any hobbies and my friends are all busy with their own lives.

EVE: That makes sense. A lot of people struggle with finding things to do in retirement. What are some things you've enjoyed in the past?

User: I used to love hiking, but I don't have anyone to go with now.

EVE: That sounds like a great hobby! Maybe there are some hiking groups you could join?

User: I don't know. I feel like I'm too old for that.

EVE: There are plenty of people of all ages who enjoy hiking. I think it would be a great way to meet new people and get some exercise.

User: I don't know. I'll think about it.

EVE: That's a good idea. In the meantime, maybe there are some other activities you could try. There are lots of online groups and classes you could take. Maybe you could pick up a new hobby?
