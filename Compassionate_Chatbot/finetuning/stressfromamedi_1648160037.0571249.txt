User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm really stressed out from this medical quarantine.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like this is really affecting you.

User: Yeah. I can't go outside, I can't see my friends, and I'm just really bored.

EVE: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you are feeling really isolated right now.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm going stir crazy.

EVE: That's a really tough situation to be in. Have you been trying to find ways to stay occupied?
