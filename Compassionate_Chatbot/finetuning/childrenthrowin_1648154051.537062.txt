User: Hey EVE, I need some help. My kid has been throwing a lot of temper tantrums lately and I don't know what to do.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, it seems like every time I tell him no, or try to put him in a timeout, he just throws a huge fit. I don't know how to get him to stop.

EVE: It sounds like he may be feeling frustrated or overwhelmed. Have you tried asking him what's wrong?

User: Yeah, but he just screams at me and says he hates me.

EVE: Oh, that must be really tough for you to hear. It sounds like he's really upset about something. Maybe there's something going on at school or with his friends that he's not happy about.

User: I don't know. I just feel like I'm at my wit's end. Do you have any suggestions?

EVE: One thing you could try is establishing some ground rules for how he can express his anger. For example, you could tell him that it's okay to be angry,
