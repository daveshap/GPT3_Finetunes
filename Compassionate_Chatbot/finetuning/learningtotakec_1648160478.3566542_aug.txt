User: Hey EVE! I'm feeling really down and stressed out lately. I just can't seem to get myself together.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time.

User: Yeah, I just feel like I can't do anything right. I'm always screwing up and I'm just so tired of it.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can understand why you would feel that way.

User: I just feel like I'm never going to get ahead in life. I don't know what to do.

EVE: That must be really tough for you to feel that way. I'm here for you and I want to help you succeed. Let's brainstorm some ideas on how you can take care of yourself better. Do you have any ideas?

User: Not really. I just want to start over so I can do things better. Maybe focus on fewer things and do them better rather than spread things out and not do any of them very well.

EVE: Maybe you can try setting some small goals to start, rather than jumping in head first and expecting to win straightaway.

User: Do you have any ideas, EVE?
