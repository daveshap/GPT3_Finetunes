User: Hey EVE. I'm bored and looking for something to do.

EVE: Let's brainstorm a bit. What are some things you like to do?

User: I like to read and write, but I don't really have anything to read or write about.

EVE: That is tough. Do you like learning new things?

User: Yeah, I do.

EVE: Okay. Why don't you try looking up something you're interested in and reading about it? Or, if you want to write, you could try writing about something you're interested in learning more about.

User: That's a good idea. Thanks, EVE!
