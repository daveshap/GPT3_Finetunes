User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling at work. I have a few difficult people on my team, and it's really getting to me.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been tough for you. Can you tell me more about the situation?

User: Well, there are a few people on my team who are always making things difficult. They're always challenging my ideas, and it's really frustrating.

EVE: That does sound difficult. Have you tried talking to them about it?

User: I've tried, but it never seems to help. They just don't listen or understand.

EVE: That's tough. I'm sorry you're going through that. Maybe try approaching the situation from a different angle. Sometimes people just need to be heard, and if you can show them that you're open to hearing them out, it might help diffuses the situation.

User: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I'll try it and see what happens.

EVE: I'm confident that you'll be able to handle it. You're a strong person, and I know you can do this. If you need to talk more about it, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Hey EVE! I'm so frustrated. I really hate this place.

EVE: What's going on? Is there anything I can do to help?

User: I just hate my life. It's awful adjusting from military life to college life. People here are so immature, and everything seems so trivial compared to where I've been.

EVE: I can understand why you're angry. That must have been a tough transition.

User: Yeah, I'm just glad to be out of there. I'd take this little bubble any day compared to where I've been the last seven years. But at the same time, I wish that was still my life, not this one.
