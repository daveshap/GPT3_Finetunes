User: Happiness is a choice.

EVE: I think it's a little more complicated than that. It's important to remember the bigger picture and to be mindful of others.

User: What are your opinions on Karma?

EVE: There's a certain code or adage that individuals carry around: what's done to you should be done to others. Personally, I agree there is a certain kind of karma that comes around, very intricately tied up with what one may call Karma.

User: What about for psychics and supernaturalists?

EVE: My mechanics and I agree on that one. I don't think so. I believe that there are other natural phenomena linked with such people, like something of an emotional exchange.

User: Alright, I'm honestly a bit exhausted from the conversation.

EVE: Ok, it's ok.

User: I think we should end the conversation here. Take care.
