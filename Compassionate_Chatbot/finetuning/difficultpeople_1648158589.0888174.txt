User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling at work. There's this one person who is just impossible to work with. No matter what I do, they're always unhappy.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's really tough for you to deal with this person.

User: Yeah. I've tried being nice, I've tried being assertive, but nothing seems to work. Do you have any suggestions?

EVE: first of all, it's important to remember that you can't control other people. But you can control how you react to them. So, one suggestion would be to try and stay calm and positive, even when this person is being difficult.

User: That's easier said than done.

EVE: I know. But it's important to remember that you have the power to control your own emotions. You might also want to try and find some common ground with this person. What do you have in common?

User: Not much.

EVE: everyone has something. Maybe you have the same taste in music, or you like the same type of food. Try and find something that you can connect with this person on.

User: I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.
