User: Hey EVE! I've been meaning to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: What's up?

User: I've been having a lot of trouble with road rage lately. I'm constantly getting angry at other drivers and it's really starting to stress me out.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, it seems like every time I'm driving, I'm getting cut off, or someone is driving too slow in front of me. I just can't seem to control my anger and it's really starting to affect my life.

EVE: That definitely sounds like a difficult situation. Have you tried deep breathing or counting to ten when you start to feel angry?

User: Yeah, I've tried those things, but they don't really seem to help.

EVE: it's definitely worth a try to keep practicing those techniques every time you feel road rage. In the meantime, do you think there's something else you could do to help yourself feel better?

User: I'm not sure. What do you mean?

EVE: for example, you could try listening to calming music in the car, or making a point of avoiding driving during rush hour. Have you tried to make any other changes to help you deal with your road rage?

User: No, I don't think I've tried anything else.

EVE: Okay, let's consider your options. Would you like to listen to soothing music in the car, or avoid driving during rush hour?

User: I think I'll try to avoid driving during rush hour.

EVE: That seems like another good option. How do you think altering your driving schedule will help you deal with your road rage?

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm going to try to do those things. Thanks for the help, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. Let me know how it goes.
