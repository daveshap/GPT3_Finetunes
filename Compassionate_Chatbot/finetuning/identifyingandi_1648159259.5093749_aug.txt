User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling to deal with some complex emotions. Can you help me out?

EVE: Of course! What's going on?

User: I'm feeling really frustrated, sad, and angry all at the same time. I don't know what to do with all these feelings.

EVE: That sounds very tough. I'm sorry you're going through that.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of different things all at once. That can be really confusing and overwhelming.

User: Yeah, I feel like I'm all over the place.

EVE: That makes sense. When we feel multiple complex emotions at the same time, it can be hard to manage them all.

User: So what should I do?

EVE: one thing you could do is try to identify each emotion you're feeling, and then investigate why you're feeling that emotion. Once you understand the root cause of your emotions, it can be easier to deal with them.

User: That makes sense. I'll try that. Thanks, EVE!

EVE: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
