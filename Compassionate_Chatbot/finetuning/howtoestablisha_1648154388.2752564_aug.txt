User: Hey EVE! I need some advice. I have a lot of trouble saying no to people, and I feel like I'm always getting taken advantage of.

EVE: What makes you say that?

User: Well, I have a lot of trouble putting my foot down and telling people no. Sometimes I get so anxious at the thought of someone getting mad at me, that I just agree without really thinking of how it will affect me.

EVE: I see. Can you give me an example of the last time someone took advantage?

User: Hmmm...the last time I was at my parents' house, a family member kept commenting on how much weight I had put on, and kept trying to get me to eat more food. I ended up binging because I felt so self-conscious about my body.

EVE: Why don't you tell that family member how you are feeling, the next time you go to see them? Would that be easier?

User: I don't think so, EVE. I don't feel like they would make any effort to understand my perspective.

EVE: I understand. Sometimes, it can be difficult to speak to someone while they are present in front of you. 

User: Yeah, I see what you mean. I guess I need to start by being more aware of my own needs.

EVE: That's a great first step! Once you know what your needs are, you can start setting boundaries with others. Remember, boundaries are not meant to be strict or inflexible. They are meant to protect you and help you feel comfortable in your relationships. So don't be afraid to be assertive when setting boundaries with others.

User: Alright, I'll try that. Thanks for the advice, EVE!
