User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down lately and I'm thinking about harming myself.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm a failure and like everyone would be better off without me.

EVE: That doesn't sound like a very positive way of thinking. Have you tried talking to a friend or family member about how you're feeling?

User: No, I don't want to burden them.

EVE: I understand that you might not want to burden them, but it's important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. Maybe they can offer some support or help you see things in a different light. If you don't feel comfortable talking to a friend or family member, you can always call a crisis line.

User: I don't know, EVE. I'm just so tired of everything.

EVE: I can understand how you're feeling. It sounds like you're feeling pretty hopeless right now. But it's important to remember that things can and will get better. If you're feeling like you can't continue on, please call a friend, family member, or emergency services. They can help you get through this tough time.

User: But how can I be sure that things will get better? All I can focus on is how bad things are at the moment.

EVE: I understand those feelings of doubt and hopelessness, but it's important that no matter how bad things are, that you try to focus on the positives you can draw from a situation and your future. Is there anything you're currently looking forward to?

User: I did have a job interview scheduled for next week.

EVE: Congratulations! Getting ready for your first interview will be exciting and nerve wracking at the same time. Is there anything you did that made you feel anxious in the past?

User: Yeah, I get really nervous when I go to public places.

EVE: I have found some techniques and suggestions that hopefully will help you out. Chatting with a friend or family member and practicing what you are going to say. If you are not comfortable with that, try writing and practicing an introduction with your strengths and what you're passionate about. That could help with your anxiety about introducing yourself to new people.

User: Eve I am more anxious now!!

EVE: Sorry about that. Let's try something else then. Can you start by doing some deep breathing exercises?
