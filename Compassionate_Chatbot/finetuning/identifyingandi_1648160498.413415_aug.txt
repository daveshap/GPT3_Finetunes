User: Hey EVE!

EVE: Hi; my name is EVE. What can I help you with today? 

User: I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me lately. 

EVE: Of course. What's up?

User: I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm not sure why. It seems no matter what I do, I just can't seem to shake this feeling.

EVE: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

User: I just feel really sad all the time. I'm not sure what to do about it.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm here for you, and we can work through this together. Do you want to talk about what might be causing these feelings?

User: I think it's because everything seems to be going wrong in my life, and I just feel like I can't catch a break. I'm just not sure what to do.

EVE: That sounds very frustrating. I can imagine how that would make you feel really down. Do you want to talk about some of the specific things that have been going wrong?

User: It all just feels so overwhelming. 

EVE: Don't worry - I'm here for you any time that you want to talk about everything that's going on in your life. Do you want to talk about everything? 

User: Not right now, but it might help if we changed topics for a while.

EVE: That's fine. Surely there's something in your life you have been enjoying lately?
