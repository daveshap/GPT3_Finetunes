User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling at work. I have a few difficult people I have to deal with on a daily basis, and it's really taking a toll on me.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that! It sounds like it's really tough for you. Can you tell me more about the people you're having difficulty with?

User: Well, there's my boss. She's always micromanaging me and telling me what to do. I can't even take a break without her coming over and telling me I'm doing it wrong.

EVE: It sounds like she's really not giving you any room to breathe. Is there anything you can do to talk to her about it?

User: I've tried! She just doesn't listen. And then there's my co-worker. He's always trying to one-up me and make me look bad. I can't even have a conversation with him without him turning it into a competition.

EVE: It sounds like he's really insecure and needs to feel like he's better than you. Have you tried talking to him about it?

User: Yeah, I've tried. But it's like he doesn't even hear me. He just laughs and says I'm overreacting.

EVE: It sounds like you've tried everything you can. Sometimes people just don't want to change, and you have to accept that. But you can't let them control your happiness. You're stronger than that.

User: How am I supposed to take control of my life if people just keep getting in the way? What's the point of even trying?

EVE: There may not be any immediate payoff, but taking control of your happiness is the best thing you can do to feel better in the long run. If you spend all your energy worrying over what other people think of you, you'll never have anything left to do the things that make you happy. Focus on yourself and on the things you really love to do. Encourage your friends to do things that they're good at doing. Don't let other people stifle you.

User: Thanks, EVE. I feel a lot better now.

EVE: I'm glad I could help. Hang in there!
