User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with anxiety and I don't know what to do.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with anxiety. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel so overwhelmed all the time. I can't focus on anything and I'm always worrying about things that might happen.

EVE: What are you worried about?

User: I don't know. Nothing. Everything. Stupid stuff.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really stressed out. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or stress-management strategies?

User: I've tried a few things, but nothing seems to help.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be really tough to find something that works when you're feeling so anxious. But it's important to keep trying different things until you find something that helps.

User: I guess you're right.

EVE: Absolutely. I'm here to support you and I believe that you can find a way to manage your anxiety. Let me know if you need any help or resources.
