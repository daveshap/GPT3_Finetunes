User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling today. I'm really upset about something that happened a long time ago, and I can't seem to let it go.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

User: It's just something that happened in my family. I don't want to go into too much detail, but it was really hurtful and I've been holding onto it for a long time.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you've been carrying this pain for a long time.

User: Yeah, I have. I'm just really tired of it. I want to let it go, but I don't know how.

EVE: first of all, it's important to remember that you're not alone. A lot of people have been through something similar and have felt the same way you do.

User: That's true.

EVE: Secondly, it's important to understand that you can't change what happened in the past, but you can change how you react to it and how you let it affect you.

User: That makes sense.

EVE: Finally, I would encourage you to talk to somebody about what happened. It can be really helpful to talk to somebody who will understand and can offer some impartial advice.

User: That's a good idea. I think I might talk to my therapist about it.

EVE: That's great! I think that would be really helpful. I'm here for you too, if you ever want to talk more about it.
