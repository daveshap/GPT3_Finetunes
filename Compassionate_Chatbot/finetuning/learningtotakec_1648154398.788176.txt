User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling a lot lately and could really use some help.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on?

User: I just feel really overwhelmed all the time. I don't know how to take care of myself and I end up feeling burnt out.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can understand how that would be really difficult to manage.

User: Yeah, it is. I don't know what to do.

EVE: One thing you could do is to try and take some time for yourself every day, even if it's just a few minutes. Do something that you enjoy or that makes you feel good, even if it's just reading a book or taking a walk.

User: That's a good idea. I think I'm going to try that.

EVE: I'm glad to hear that. Let me know how it goes!
