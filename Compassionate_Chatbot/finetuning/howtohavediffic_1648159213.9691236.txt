User: Hey EVE! I've been having some trouble communicating with my spouse lately. We always end up getting into arguments and it's really putting a strain on our relationship. Do you have any advice on how to have difficult conversations without them turning into arguments?

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble communicating with your spouse. It sounds like it's really taking a toll on your relationship. There are a few things you can do to try and avoid arguments when having difficult conversations. First, try to be as understanding and compassionate as possible. Listen to what your spouse is saying and try to see things from their perspective. Second, be honest with your spouse about how you're feeling and what you're thinking. Don't try to hide your feelings or downplay them. Finally, try to come up with a compromise that will work for both of you.
