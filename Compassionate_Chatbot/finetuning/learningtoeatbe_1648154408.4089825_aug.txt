User: Hey EVE! I really need some help. I'm really bad at eating healthy.

EVE: I'm happy to help you out. Let's start by talking about what you typically eat in a day.

User: Well, on weekdays, I usually have a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast, a sandwich or a burger for lunch, and then pasta or pizza for dinner.

EVE: That doesn't sound too bad, but we can definitely improve it. Let me do some research. One moment please.

User: That sounds great! I'm definitely willing to try it.

EVE: Awesome! I'm confident that you can do it. Just take it one meal at a time and you'll be surprised at how quickly it becomes second nature.
