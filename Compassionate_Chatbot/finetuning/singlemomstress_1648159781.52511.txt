User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling a lot lately. I'm a single mom and I feel like I'm constantly stressed out. I don't know how to balance everything and I'm just feeling really overwhelmed.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed out. Being a single mom is really tough. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Well, I just feel like I'm constantly juggling everything and I'm never able to relax. I have to take care of my kids, work, and the house and I just feel like I'm always running around. I don't know how to slow down.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you're feeling stressed out. Have you tried taking some time for yourself? Even if it's just a few minutes a day, it can make a big difference.

User: I don't really have time for that. I feel like I'm always busy and there's never a break.

EVE: That's a common feeling, but it's important to try to make time for yourself. It doesn't have to be a lot, but even just a few minutes to relax can make a big difference. Maybe you can try taking a bath or reading a book before bed. Just something to help you relax and unwind.

User: That's a good idea. I think I'm going to try that. Thanks, EVE.
