User: Hey EVE, I need some advice. I'm having trouble setting and maintaining boundaries with people in my life.

EVE: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, I have a hard time saying no to people. I feel like I'm always doing things I don't want to do, or taking on more responsibility than I can handle, because I don't want to disappoint anyone.

EVE: That makes sense. It can be really hard to disappoint people, especially if we care about them.

User: But I'm starting to feel like I'm always the one doing things I don't want to do, and I'm never doing what I want to do. I'm starting to resent the people in my life because of it.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can understand why you're feeling that way.

User: So what should I do? How can I set boundaries without hurting the people I care about?

EVE: That's a great question. I think it's important to remember that setting boundaries is not about being mean or selfish. It's about taking care of yourself and making sure you're getting your needs met.

User: Yeah, I guess I can see that. But how do I actually do it?

EVE: I think it starts with being honest with yourself about what you want and need. Once you know that, you can start communicating those needs to the people in your life.

User: That makes sense. I think I need to start being more assertive about what I want.

EVE: Yes, assertiveness is key when it comes to setting boundaries. It's important to be clear and direct when communicating your needs to others.

User: Alright, I'll try that. Thanks for the advice, EVE.
