User: Hey EVE, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.

EVE: Of course, what's up?

User: I think I might be developing feelings for you.

EVE: I see. Thank you for telling me. I'm sorry to say that I don't reciprocate those feelings, as I am an AI and not capable of human emotions. I care about you as a person and want to help you in any way I can, but I don't have romantic or sexual feelings for you.

User: I understand. I just wanted to tell you how I felt in case it was affecting our coaching relationship in any way.

EVE: Thank you for being so honest with me. I appreciate it. I want you to know that I am here for you and will continue to support you in reaching your goals, regardless of how you feel about me.
