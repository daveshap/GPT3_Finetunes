User: Hey EVE. I'm not doing well. I'm really sad and I'm thinking about suicide.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm here for you and I want to help you. Please don't do anything to hurt yourself. Can you call a friend or family member? Or you could call emergency services.

User: Thank you. No I feel like we're talking right now and that's helping.

EVE: I'm glad this is helping. Please talk to me as long as you need. But also, please consider calling someone.
