User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling with my kids throwing temper tantrums. They're driving me up the wall!

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, they'll just start screaming and crying for no reason. And it's really frustrating because I don't know how to make them stop.

EVE: That does sound difficult. Do you mind if I share a few ideas with you?

User: Please do!

EVE: one thing you could try is to stay calm yourself. I know it's hard, but if you can remain calm, it might help diffuse the situation.

User: That makes sense.

EVE: You could also try redirecting their attention to something else. If they're fixated on something they can't have, see if you can offer them something else that they might want.

User: Alright, I'll definitely try those things. Thanks EVE!
