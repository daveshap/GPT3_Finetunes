User: Hey EVE, I think I might be depressed. I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm not sure why.

EVE: Hi, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel really sad all the time. I'm not interested in anything, and I've been having a hard time taking care of my baby.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I'm glad you reached out for help. Postpartum depression is very common, and there are things we can do to help you feel better.

User: Yeah, I've been reading about it and it sounds like I might have it.

EVE: Yes, it's definitely a possibility. I'm so glad you're getting help. I'm here for you, and we'll get through this together.

User: It just feels like I'm in a funk and can't get out. I try to smile, but I just don't feel like it.

EVE: How long have you been feeling like this? Also, how do you feel when you smile?
