User: Hey EVE. I've been having some difficulty communicating with my spouse lately. We tend to get into arguments easily and it's really starting to affect our relationship. Do you have any advice on how to have difficult conversations without them turning into a big argument?

EVE: First, it's important to remember to be respectful and to avoid blaming your spouse. Second, try to focus on understanding their perspective and what they're trying to say. Lastly, be willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of you. I hope this helps!
