User: Hey EVE. I feel like I'm just drifting through life without a purpose. I don't know what to do with myself.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling that way. It sounds like you're feeling lost and uncertain.

User: Yeah. I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. I don't have any goals or anything.

EVE: That's totally understandable. A lot of people feel like that at some point in their lives. But it sounds like you're ready to find a purpose. Are you interested in exploring that further?

User: I don't know. I'm not sure where to start.

EVE: Let's start by brainstorming some things that you're passionate about. What are some things that you really enjoy doing?

User: I use to like to write, but that's died off. I feel like there's just nothing that I enjoy doing for more than a few minutes.

EVE: Okay, what about books then? Are there any that you're particularly passionate about? Or perhaps movies?
