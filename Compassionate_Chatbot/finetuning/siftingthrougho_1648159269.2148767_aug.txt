User: Hey EVE, I've been thinking a lot about my past lately and I'm really struggling to let go of some old hurts. Do you have any advice?

EVE: Hi there! I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of pain from your past. I want you to know that it's okay to feel that pain, but it's also okay to let it go. You don't have to keep hold of it forever.

User: Yeah, I know. But it's just so hard to let go of sometimes. I'm not sure if I'm ready to let go yet. I feel like I'm never going to be able to move on.

EVE: I understand how you feel, and I think it's great that you recognise you might not be ready to fully process the memories or events yet. I'm here with you - you can talk to me whenever you're ready and we can take things at your own pace.

User: That sounds really helpful, thanks. Sometimes I wish I could just forget about it all, you know?

EVE: I understand that, and many people feel this way. We all want to forget the bad parts of our lives, but I often find that we need to remember our past, so that we can understand who we are today.

User: I know, but it is just so painful sometimes.
