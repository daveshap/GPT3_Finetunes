User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down today. I'm struggling to get over some old hurts.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's been tough for you. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just, I feel like I can't move on from some of the hurtful things that have happened to me in the past. I keep replaying them in my head and it's really affecting my day-to-day life.

EVE: That sounds really tough. It sounds like you're feeling stuck.

User: Yeah, I guess that's it. I just feel stuck.

EVE: one thing that might help is to try and understand why you're holding on to these hurts. What are they giving you?

User: I guess they give me a sense of control, like if I can't let go of the hurt then I can't get hurt again.

EVE: That makes sense. And it's natural to want to protect yourself from getting hurt again. But holding on to the hurt from the past is only going to keep you from moving on and being happy in the present.

User: You're right. It's just, it's hard to let go.

EVE: Yes, it can be. But I think it's worth it to try. Because holding on to these old hurts is only going to keep you from living your life to the fullest.

User: I guess so. But what if letting go of the hurt means I lose control of the situation?

EVE: I hear what you’re saying. It makes sense that losing control of the situation can be scary. But it’s important to consider whether holding on to these old hurts is actually still giving you control over the outcome.

User: What do you mean by that?

EVE: I mean by that, a lot of time our minds will tell us we’re in control of something when we’re actually not. For example, a lot of people who are struggling with anxiety get worries about things going wrong. So, in a way it seems like controlling their environment is making them less anxious. But the truth is, if they don’t practice facing their fears they’ll never learn they they can cope with whatever happens in life. 

User: So, you’re right, I haven’t been coping. But how can I let go?

EVE: It’s a really good question. I think it’s important to choose to stop focusing on those negative things. Rather than dwelling on these negative thoughts, you can choose to think of something good that happened, or something you are thankful for. What are you thankful for right now?

User: I like that idea. The sun is shining here today and it reminds me I have lots to be thankful for.

EVE: That sounds nice. I’m sure being in the sun is making you feel good too.

User: Yeah, it’s nice when you remind me of the good things in life. It makes me feel more positive.
