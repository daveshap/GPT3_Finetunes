User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm retired and I'm really lonely.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It's tough to be lonely, especially when you're retired. What do you like to do?

User: I used to like to read, but I can't focus on anything anymore.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be hard to focus when you're lonely. Maybe you could try joining a book club or finding an online book club to chat with people about what you're reading.

User: I don't know. I don't read anymore. I can't, I just feel so lost.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling lost and lonely. That's tough. Maybe there are some activities you used to enjoy that you could start doing again. Or, maybe there are some new activities you've always wanted to try. What sounds fun to you?

User: I'm not sure what to do.

EVE: It sounds like you're not sure what to try. There are lots of groups you could consider joining. You could look in your local newspaper and at community resources to find possibilities. Phone a friend and see if they'd want to do something with you, too.
