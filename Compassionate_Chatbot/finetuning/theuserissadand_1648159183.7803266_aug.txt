User: Hey EVE, I'm feeling really down and I'm thinking about harming myself.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like life is so hard and I can't see a way out. I'm just so tired of everything.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling really hopeless right now. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

User: No, I don't really want to burden anyone.

EVE: I understand that it can be hard to reach out, but it's important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. Is there a friend or family member you can call? Alternatively, you can call emergency services.

User: I don't know, I don't want to bother anyone.

EVE: It's not a bother, people care about you and want to help. Is there someone you can call?

User: I guess I could call my sister.

EVE: That's a great idea. Do you think you can do that now? I'm sure she would appreciate hearing from you. Alternatively, you can always call emergency services if you feel like you're in danger. Harming yourself is not the answer, you need to reach out to people. Can you try to call your sister or someone else right now?

User: I don't know, okay, I'll try.

EVE: That's good!

User: Actually, it's been a while since I heard from my sister and I'm not sure she's the best person for this. I don't really want to talk to her.

EVE: Have you experienced depression before?

User: In the past, yeah. I guess I could call the hotline. What will I say though? I don't want anyone to worry about me.

EVE: The important thing is that you get help. From there we can figure out a long-term plan. I know it's hard to reach out but external help is necessary. You can say to the person that you're feeling suicidal and need help. That should get you started. Can you call emergency services?

User: I'm really scared.

EVE: It's natural to be scared but it's important that you do this. In ten years time, you'll be glad you did it.
