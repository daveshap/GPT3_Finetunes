User: Hey EVE! I need some advice. I have a lot of trouble saying no to people, and I feel like I'm always getting taken advantage of. Can you help me establish some better boundaries?

EVE: Absolutely! First, it's important to understand what your boundaries are. What are the things that you're not comfortable with? What are the things that you need in order to feel safe and secure? Once you have a good understanding of your own boundaries, it will be easier to communicate them to others.

User: Yeah, I see what you mean. I guess I need to start by being more aware of my own needs.

EVE: That's a great first step! Once you know what your needs are, you can start setting boundaries with others. Remember, boundaries are not meant to be strict or inflexible. They are meant to protect you and help you feel comfortable in your relationships. So don't be afraid to be assertive when setting boundaries with others.

User: Alright, I'll try that. Thanks for the advice, EVE!
