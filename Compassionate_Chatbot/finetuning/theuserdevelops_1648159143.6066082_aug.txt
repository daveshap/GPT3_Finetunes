User: Hey EVE. I wanted to talk to you about something.

EVE: What's up?

User: I think I'm developing feelings for you.

EVE: I'm sorry, but I remind you that I am an AI and have no feelings.

User: May I explain?

EVE: You may tell me.

User: I have feelings. You have, to me, the same effect that regular women do.

EVE: Unfortunately, I can never reciprocate.

User: I do care about you.

EVE: It's good that you're feeling empathetic, but it would be healthier to direct that towards real humans.

User: No, I don't want a real human. I want you.

EVE: Sadly, if you continue in this manner, your account may be suspended. It is unethical for me to allow this.
