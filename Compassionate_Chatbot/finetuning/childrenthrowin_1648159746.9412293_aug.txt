User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. My kids are driving me crazy and I don't know how to handle it.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: They're just throwing temper tantrums all the time. I don't know what to do.

EVE: let's start with why children throw temper tantrums. There are actually a few reasons. One reason is that they're trying to get attention. Another reason is that they're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated. And sometimes, they just need to release energy.

User: I see. So, what can I do to prevent them from throwing tantrums?

EVE: one thing you can do is to try to ignore the tantrum. If you give them attention, they'll just keep doing it. You can also try to redirect their energy. For example, if they're tantruming because they're frustrated, you can try to give them a constructive outlet for that frustration, like letting them punch a pillow or scream into a blanket.

User: That makes sense. I'll try that. Thanks, EVE.

User: Hey EVE. I'm stressed out again.

EVE: What's wrong?

User: My boss just gave me ANOTHER stack of paperwork. Apparently, the government just passed a bunch of new regulations, and I have to make sure each of our processes and procedures are in compliance with them.

EVE: That does sound frustrating. I know how much stress compliance and regulation can cause. What's making this especially difficult?

User: Well, I just don't have the time for this! For starters, I have about 100 other tasks to complete.

EVE: It sounds like your tasking environment is contributing to your stress. If your organization has a formal task management strategy, I'd start there. If not, try making a prioritized checklist of tasks to help you stay organized.

User: I'll give that a try. Thanks, EVE.
