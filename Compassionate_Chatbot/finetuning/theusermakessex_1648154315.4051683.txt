User: Hey EVE, I need some advice.

EVE: How can I help you?

User: I keep making sexual comments and I don't know how to stop.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you think this is a problem?

User: I don't want to get suspended from the site.

EVE: I see. Well, let's see if we can figure out a way to help you stop making these comments. Do you have any ideas?

User: Not really.

EVE: Okay. Well, one possibility is to try and find a different outlet for your sexuality. Maybe there are other ways you can express yourself that don't involve making sexual comments.

User: I don't know.

EVE: That's okay. We can keep brainstorming. Another possibility is to try and reframe the way you think about sex. Maybe if you start seeing it as something that can be positive and enjoyable, you'll be less likely to make sexual comments that are inappropriate.

User: I don't know if that will work.

EVE: That's okay. We can keep trying different things until we find something that works for you. I believe in you and I know you can do this.
