User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm really stressed out from this medical quarantine.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like this is really affecting you.

User: Yeah. I can't go outside, I can't see my friends, and I'm just really bored.

EVE: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you are feeling really isolated right now.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm going stir crazy.

EVE: That's a really tough situation to be in. Have you been trying to find ways to stay occupied?

User: I haven't been. I've just been on my phone or watching TV for hours. I would go outside but I can't.

EVE: It's okay to spend time on the phone and watching TV, but this situation is really extreme. It's really isolating, and there are a lot of things you can do to keep yourself occupied that aren't on your phone.
