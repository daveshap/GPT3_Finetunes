User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. I'm really depressed.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?

User: Everything just seems so hopeless. I don't know how to make it better.

EVE: Let's start with why you're feeling this way. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I'm stuck in this hole that I can't get out of. I'm trying, but it feels like everything I do is just making things worse.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can see how that would be really tough to deal with.

User: I don't know what to do. I just feel so lost.

EVE: First of all, it's important to remember that you're not alone. Lots of people deal with depression, and there are resources available to help you. I'm here for you, and I'll do whatever I can to help you through this.

User: Thank you, EVE. Just knowing you're here for me makes me feel a little better.

EVE: Of course. I want to see you succeed. Let's brainstorm some ideas for how to make things better. Have you tried therapy or medication?
