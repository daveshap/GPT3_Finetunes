User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling because I'm single and feeling really lonely.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like being single is really hard for you right now.

User: Yeah, I just don't know how to meet people. I've been single for a while and I'm just feeling really down about it.

EVE: That makes sense. It can be tough to put yourself out there, but there are lots of ways to meet new people. Maybe you could try joining a meetup group or taking a class?

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I just feel like I'm not really good at meeting people.

EVE: That's totally normal! A lot of people feel that way. But the more you put yourself out there, the easier it will become. And who knows, you might just meet some great friends along the way.
