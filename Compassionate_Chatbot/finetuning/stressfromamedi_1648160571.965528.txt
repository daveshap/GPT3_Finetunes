User: Hey EVE, I'm struggling. I'm really stressed out from this medical quarantine.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. It sounds like this quarantine is really taking a toll on your mental health.

User: Yeah, I'm just really stir crazy. I feel like I'm going insane.

EVE: It's totally normal to feel that way. A lot of people are feeling the same way. Quarantine can be really tough.

User: But what am I supposed to do? I can't just sit around and do nothing.

EVE: first of all, it's important to give yourself a break. Don't put so much pressure on yourself to be productive all the time. It's okay to relax and take some time for yourself.

User: But I can't just sit around all day. I'll go crazy.

EVE: Maybe you can find some creative ways to occupy your time. Maybe you can start a new hobby or learn a new skill?

User: That's a good idea. I think I'm going to try to pick up painting.

EVE: That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure you'll be great at it.
