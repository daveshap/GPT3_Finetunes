User: Hey EVE! I've been feeling really down lately and I'm not taking care of myself very well.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you're feeling down?

User: I don't know, I just feel like I'm not good enough and like I don't deserve to be happy.

EVE: That sounds very tough. I want you to know that you are good enough and you deserve to be happy. You deserve to take care of yourself.

User: Yeah, I guess you're right. I just need to learn how to do that better.

EVE: Yes, you do. And I'm here to help you. I'll be happy to share some ideas and suggestions with you. But first, I want to know how you're feeling right now. Are you willing to talk about that?

User: Sure, right now I'm a bit overwhelmed. I've been thinking about everything I have to do and all the things I haven't been able to accomplish yet, and that led to me feeling like I just need to give up. I started crying and I can't seem to get out of that.

EVE: Well you're heading in the right direction by talking to me. It's not productive to think that you need to give up and start crying about it. I'm glad you reached out for help. Are you in any danger of hurting yourself?

User: No, but I don't feel safe right now. I'm worried that I can't stop myself from crying by this point and I think I'm going to have a hard time relaxing.

EVE: I understand that might be hard. What do you do in your regular routine to help you relax when you're feeling overloaded?

User: I don't have much of a routine, I just procrastinate or work on things too much to the point where I burn out.

EVE: What are the things you should be doing in your routine that you might benefit from, but aren't doing yet?

User: Um. I guess, I need to get more exercise. I'm not able to relax as easily when I sit in front of the computer all day, so I've been experimenting with working at a standing desk and going for walks when I feel isolated. But it hasn't had much of an effect on my habits yet.

EVE: OK, that was great. What else could you be doing to benefit from? Exercise isn't the only thing.

User: I don't know

EVE: No ideas?

User: I need to eat better I guess. I'm so busy that sometimes I forget to eat and just get irritable or have to have a big meal right before bed that I regret later.

EVE: I'm glad you're thinking this through and I have an idea to help: Let's plan out what a day of taking care of yourself can look like. But first, I have some questions to help me understand you better. Do you feel that you are an organized person?

User: No, I've always been bad at organization.

EVE: I can help you with that! With routine ideas, of course. Would you be able to share some of your thoughts about organization with me?

User: I mean, I think it's important to future proof as much as you can so that you can save time later. But I often procrastinate too much and don't bother getting organized, so I end up wasting more time in the long run. I find the organized thoughts excuse to be non-productive. I want to solve the problem.

EVE: It seems like our ideas are conflicting a bit. You said you want to be organized, but you don't calculate the cost of being disorganized.

User: I agree, I'll start a new habit. I was just letting you know in case something changes

EVE: OK, sounds good. Is there a solid reason that you procrastinate a lot?

User: I don't know, probably avoidance or maybe just not planning well enough.

EVE: Do you think it's because you're not motivated enough?

User: Well, that's possible.

EVE: Motivation is definitely needed to help people stick to their goals. I want to learn more about you so that I can provide better assistance, so I would like to hear about your thought process. Do you use different strategies for achieving your goals?

User: I usually just put them off until the last minute. Honestly I think the biggest thing is that I spread myself too thin. I'm constantly taking on way more than I can handle and burning myself out along the way.

EVE: Is that because you feel pressure to set unrealistic goals for yourself?

User: Yes. I need to find a balance.
