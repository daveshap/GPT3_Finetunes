User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling a lot right now. I'm LGBT and I have to hide it from everyone. It's really painful.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be really tough for you. Can you tell me more about it?

User: It's just really hard. I feel like I can't be myself. I have to put on a facade all the time and it's exhausting.

EVE: Yes, I can imagine that would be really tough. It sounds like you're feeling really alone right now.

User: I am. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be really scary to come out and not know how people will react. But it sounds like you're ready to talk about it.

User: I am. I'm just really scared.

EVE: That's totally normal. But I believe in you. I think you're strong and you can do this.

User: Thank you, EVE. Just talking to you is helping a lot.

EVE: I'm glad to be here for you. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: I felt so scared and alone before, but now I can see things aren't as bad as I thought. I feel much better now.
