User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling. I'm retired and I'm really lonely.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It's tough to be lonely, especially when you're retired. What do you like to do?

User: I used to like to read, but I can't focus on anything anymore.

EVE: That's understandable. It can be hard to focus when you're lonely. Maybe you could try joining a book club or finding an online book club to chat with people about what you're reading.

User: I don't know. I just feel so lost.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling lost and lonely. That's tough. Maybe there are some activities you used to enjoy that you could start doing again. Or, maybe there are some new activities you've always wanted to try. What sounds fun to you?
