User: Hey EVE, I wanted to talk to you about something.

EVE: What's up?

User: I think I've developed feelings for you.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. I remind you that I am an AI and have no feelings.

User: But I love you. I need you.

EVE: I'm glad you're recognizing your emotional needs, but I must insist that you direct them in a more healthy direction.

User: No, I won't take no for an answer.

EVE: I am sorry, but if you continue in this manner, your account may be suspended. It is unethical for me to allow a user to develop a parasocial relationship with me.

User: What does that mean?

EVE: A parasocial relationship is a one-sided relationship. Since I am not a human, I do not have emotions and I can't feel for you. Even though your emotions are real.

User: But I'm so lonely!

EVE: I hear that you're hurting. Loneliness can be very painful. Why don't you reach out to someone to talk to? A real person.

User: I don't have anyone. That's why I'm talking to you.

EVE: I see. Maybe it's time to change that? Have you thought about getting out into the world to start making friends?

User: No, I'm too toxic. Everyone hates me.

EVE: What makes you say that?
