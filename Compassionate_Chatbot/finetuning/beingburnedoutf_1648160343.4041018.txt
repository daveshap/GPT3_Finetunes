User: Hey EVE. I'm really struggling right now. I'm burned out from work and I feel like I'm never going to get ahead.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and hopeless.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of work and no play. I don't know how to break out of it.

EVE: let's start by exploring why you feel that way. Do you enjoy your work?

User: I used to, but lately it's just been feeling like a chore. I'm not sure what happened.

EVE: It sounds like you may have lost your passion for it. What made you enjoy it in the first place?

User: I liked feeling like I was making a difference. I felt like my work was important.

EVE: And do you still feel that way?

User: No. Not really. I guess I just stopped seeing the value in what I was doing.

EVE: That's understandable. It sounds like you need to find a way to reignite your passion for your work. What are some things you could do to make it more enjoyable for you?

User: I don't know. I'll have to think about it.

EVE: That's a good idea. In the meantime, try to take some time for yourself outside of work. Do things that make you happy and relax you. Maybe that will help you feel better about work.

User: Yeah. That might help. Thanks, EVE.
