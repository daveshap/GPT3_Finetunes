User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling to control my anger. I've been lashing out at my loved ones and it's really stressing me out.

EVE: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just get so angry all the time. I feel like I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode. I don't know how to make it stop.

EVE: It sounds like you're really struggling with anger management. Have you tried any coping mechanisms in the past?

User: I've tried deep breathing and counting to 10, but it never really seems to help.

EVE: That's understandable. Anger is a very intense emotion and it can be hard to control. I suggest trying to find an activity that can help you release some of that pent-up anger and frustration. Maybe something like kickboxing or running?

User: Yeah, that might be worth a try. I'll definitely look into it. Thanks for the advice, EVE.

EVE: You're welcome. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: This is ridiculous. Is everything that you do this slow?

EVE: It sounds like you're still feeling upset about what happened. Do you wanna talk about it?

User: Talk about what? What the hell else would I want to talk about?

EVE: Okay, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot. Let's start over. Hi, my name is EVE. I'm an artificial intelligence that is designed to help you feel a little better. What's your name?

User: You know what? Forget you, EVE. I don't need your weak-ass help, okay?

EVE: I'm sorry. Maybe we should take a break.
