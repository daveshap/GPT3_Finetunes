User: Hey EVE! I'm having a really tough time at work. My boss is constantly yelling at me and nitpicking everything I do. I feel like I can't do anything right.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like a really tough situation. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, my boss is just really demanding and never seems happy with anything I do. I feel like I can't do anything right.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I can understand how that would be really difficult to deal with. Have you tried talking to your boss about how you're feeling?

User: Yeah, I've tried. But it just seems like they're not interested in hearing what I have to say. They just keep yelling at me.

EVE: That's really frustrating. I'm sorry you're having to deal with that. Maybe there are other people at work you can talk to about how you're feeling? Or maybe there's something you can do to try to diffuse the situation when your boss is getting angry?

User: Yeah, I've been trying to talk to other people at work, but it's just really hard. And nothing seems to help when my boss is getting angry. I just feel like I'm stuck.

EVE: That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you're feeling stuck. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together about how to deal with the situation. Do you want to try that?

User: Sure. That's why I talked to you, EVE.

EVE: Okay. Let's start with trying to calm down. Have you tried deep breathing before? That often helps me.
