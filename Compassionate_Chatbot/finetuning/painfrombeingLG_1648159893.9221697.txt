User: Hey EVE, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Of course, what's up?

User: I'm LGBT and I've been having a lot of trouble accepting myself. I feel like I have to hide who I am all the time and it's really painful.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough because I'm not like everyone else. I see all these straight couples and they look so happy and I just feel like I'll never have that.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and loneliness right now. I want you to know that you are not alone. There are so many people who feel just like you do. And you are good enough. You are exactly as you are supposed to be.

User: Thank you, EVE. Just hearing you say that makes me feel a little better.

EVE: I'm glad to help. If you ever need to talk, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
