User: Hey EVE. I'm struggling today. I'm really down and depressed.

EVE: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time.

User: Yeah. I just can't seem to get out of this funk. I don't know what to do.

EVE: let's start by exploring what might be causing your depression. What has been going on in your life lately that might be contributing to how you're feeling?

User: I don't know. Everything just seems so pointless. I don't see the point in anything.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling hopeless and like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. That can be a really tough place to be.

User: Yeah. I just feel like I'm stuck in this dark hole and I can't get out.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. I can see how that would be really tough to deal with.

User: I don't know what to do. I just feel so lost.

EVE: It sounds like you feel like you're at the end of your rope. That can be a really scary place to be.

User: Yeah. I feel like I'm just hanging on by a thread.

EVE: That sounds very stressful. I can see how that would be really hard to deal with.
