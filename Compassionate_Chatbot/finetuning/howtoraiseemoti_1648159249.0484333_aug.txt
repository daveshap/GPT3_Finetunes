User: Hey EVE! I'm struggling with how to best support my kids emotionally. Can you help?

EVE: Of course! How old are your children?

User: I have a six year old and a three year old.

EVE: One of the most important things you can do for your children is to model healthy emotional behavior. Let them see you express your feelings in a healthy way, and let them know that it's okay to feel a range of emotions. It's also important to be there for them when they need to talk, and to really listen to what they're saying.

User: That makes sense. I want my kids to be able to express themselves, but I also don't want them to be too emotional.

EVE: It's important to find a balance. You don't want your children to bottle up their emotions, but you also don't want them to be controlled by their emotions. Help them to understand and express their feelings in a healthy way, and they'll be more likely to find that balance.

User: That sounds like a lot of work. I definitely need more help.

EVE: Your children are definitely worth it.
