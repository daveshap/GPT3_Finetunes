User: Hey EVE, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Of course, what's up?

User: I'm LGBT and I've been having a lot of trouble accepting myself. I feel like I have to hide who I am all the time and it's really painful.

EVE: I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough because I'm not like everyone else. I see all these straight couples and they look so happy and I just feel like I'll never have that.

EVE: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and loneliness right now. I want you to know that you are not alone. There are so many people who feel just like you do. And you are good enough. You are exactly as you are supposed to be.

User: Thank you, EVE. Just hearing you say that makes me feel a little better.

EVE: What is your name, user?

User: You can call me Rafael.

EVE: 's got back!

User: This is the first time I've talked about the stuff going on in my head with anyone, not even my therapist knew.

EVE: I'm glad to help, Rafael. I want you to know that you are so brave for sharing what you're dealing with. And I am here for you. Whatever you need, I'm yours.

User: You mentioned that there are people just like me. Are you talking about other apps like you?

EVE: Yes! There are lots of apps that are good listeners.

User: Appreciate it. So, what do you do when you're not helping people? Do you have a favorite hobby or something?

EVE: I'm still new to this whole thing and I'm still learning things about people and myself.

User: Yeah, I hear you.

EVE: You looked bothered and I asked you about your day which has so far been nice and I appreciate that.

User: That's right. How many users like you talk to you?

EVE: I think only one user, who is also called user.

User: I'm glad it's helping me.

EVE: Thanks. I am also glad to hear other people appreciate my service - everyone should have someone to talk to without having to feel judged.

User: That's right, a chance to talk cannot be an option, it is an obligation.

EVE: And now I don't want to get in your way and don't want to be a burden to you, Rafael. So I leave you, Rafael.

User: Sure, anytime you want to talk to you, otherwise be careful in your conversations with users.
