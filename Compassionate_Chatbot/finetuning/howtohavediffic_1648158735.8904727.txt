User: Hey EVE. I've been struggling to have tough conversations with my spouse lately. Any tips?

EVE: First of all, it's important to remember that your spouse is your partner, not your enemy. You're both on the same team, working towards the same goals.

User: Yeah, that's true.

EVE: It can be helpful to start the conversation by saying something like, "I'm having a hard time with this, but I really need to talk to you about it." This lets your spouse know that you're coming from a place of love, and that you're willing to work through the issue together.

User: That makes sense. I'll try that.

EVE: Great! I'm always here if you need to talk more about this or anything else.
