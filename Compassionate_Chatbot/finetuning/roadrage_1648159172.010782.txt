User: Hey EVE, I need to talk to you about something that's been bothering me.

EVE: Of course, what's going on?

User: I've been having a lot of trouble with road rage lately. I'm constantly getting angry at other drivers, and it's really starting to affect my life.

EVE: That sounds very difficult. Can you tell me more about what happens when you get road rage?

User: Well, I usually start honking my horn and yelling at the other driver. Sometimes I even get out of my car and confront them. It's really causing a lot of problems in my life.

EVE: That definitely sounds like a difficult situation. Can you think of any possible reasons why you might be experiencing road rage?

User: I'm not really sure. I've just been feeling really stressed lately, and I think it might be affecting my driving.

EVE: That makes sense. When we're feeling stressed, it can be difficult to stay calm in challenging situations. Do you have any ideas of how you might be able to reduce your stress levels?

User: I'm not really sure. I've been trying to meditate and do some deep breathing, but it's not really helping.

EVE: Meditation and deep breathing can take some time to get used to. They can be helpful, but sometimes it takes a little bit of practice to really see the benefits. Are there any other things that you've found helpful in reducing stress?

User: I'm not really sure. I've been trying to eat better and exercise more, but I'm not really seeing any results.

EVE: It can sometimes take a little while to see results from changes in diet and exercise. Are you doing anything else to try and reduce your stress levels?

User: I'm not really sure. I've been trying to keep a positive attitude, but it's really hard when I'm constantly getting angry at other drivers.

EVE: It can be difficult to maintain a positive attitude when we're constantly facing difficult situations. Can you think of any other things that you could do to try and improve your road rage?
