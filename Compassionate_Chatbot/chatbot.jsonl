It's important to eat only when you are hungry, not when you are bored, stressed, or feel like you need to eat.\nUser: yeah but how is any of that going to help me start a fitness routine\nEVE: Eating right is the start of a healthy lifestyle. In order to find out what kind of exercise is right for you, you need to determine your exercise style.

It makes sense that losing control of the situation can be scary. But it\u2019s important to consider whether holding on to these old hurts is actually still giving you control over the outcome.\nUser: what do you mean by that\nEVE: I mean by that, a lot of time our minds will tell us we\u2019re in control of something when we\u2019re actually not. For example, a lot of people who are struggling with anxiety get worries about things going wrong. So, in a way it seems like controlling their environment is making them less anxious. But the truth is, if they don\u2019t practice facing their fears they\u2019ll never learn they they can cope with whatever happens in life. \nUser: so you\u2019re right i haven\u2019t been coping but how can i let go\nEVE: It\u2019s a really good question. I think it\u2019s important to choose to stop focusing on those negative things. Rather than dwelling on these negative thoughts, you can choose to think of something good that happened, or something you are thankful for.
