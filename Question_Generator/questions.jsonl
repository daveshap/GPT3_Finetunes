After anesthesia was administered, time out was taken to ensure correct patient, procedure, and site. The face was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The right ear tag was examined first. This was a small piece of skin and cartilaginous material protruding just from the tragus. The lesion was excised and injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and then excised using an elliptical-style incision. Dissection was carried down the subcutaneous tissue to remove any cartilaginous attachment to the tragus. After this was done, the wound was cauterized and then closed using interrupted 5-0 Monocryl. Attention was then turned towards the palate. The Dingman mouthgag was inserted and the palate was injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine. After giving this 5 minutes to take effect, the palate was incised along its margins. The anterior oral mucosa was lifted off and held demonstrating the underlying levator muscle. Muscle was freed up from its attachments at the junction of the hard palate and swept down so that it will be approximated across the midline. The Z-plasties were then designed, so there would be opposing Z-plasties from the nasal mucosa compared to the oral mucosa. The nasal mucosa was sutured first using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl. Next, the muscle was reapproximated using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl with an attempt to overlap the muscle in the midline. In addition, the remnant of the uvula tissue was found and was sutured in such a place that it would add some extra bulk to the nasal surface of the palate. Following this, the oral layer of mucosa was repaired using an opposing Z-plasty compared to the nasal layer. This was also sutured in place using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.

The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal. The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture. This was done twice. The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision. The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field. The sac was then opened completely around the testis. The appendix testis was cauterized. We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture. Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely. Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions.

This loose body was then subsequently removed. It measured 24 x 14 mm. This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:, The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain. He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee. The patient presented here for a second opinion. Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The standard portals were marked on the skin. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade. Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line. There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch. This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal. Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis. The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology. ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.,Attention was then turned back to the large defect. The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver. Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances. Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites. All instruments were then removed. The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl. A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee. Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias. The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes. He was taken to recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:, The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family. The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos. There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle. His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.

A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint with the above noted findings.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region. The scope was placed. A lateral portal was created. Gross bursectomy was carried out. This was done with a 4.2 meniscal shaver as well as a hot Bovie. Calcium deposition mentioned was removed. With the rotator cuff intact, the periosteum was burned off the undersurface of the acromion and the CA ligament released anteriorly. A subacromial decompression sequentially from laterally to medially was then carried out. There was an excellent decompression. Debridement was carried out to the bursa. The portals were ultimately closed with #4-0 after Pain Buster catheter had been placed. Subacromial region was flooded with 0.5% Marcaine at approximately 15 cc or so.

The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel. His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula. The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock. The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule. The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area. The biceps tendon was noted to be intact. The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved. The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact. The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury. There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch. Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum. Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position. A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position. The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable. With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks. An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position. Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area. At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary. The arthroscopic instruments were removed. An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold. The skin incision was taken down through the skin. Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis. The deltopectoral fascia was identified. It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally. The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs. The conjoint tendon was identified. The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor. The subscapularis tendon was identified. It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later. The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially. This allowed for visualization of the capsule. The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair. It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position. This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint. The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified. The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock. The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely. At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated. The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips. 0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia. The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues. Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7. Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen. This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well. This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed. At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam. Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7. These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size. The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc. The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.

{"prompt": "Thyroid Mass Consult, REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy. The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004. An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed. When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there. The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction. She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism. There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family. She has no notable discomfort with this lesion. There have been no skin changes. Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Essentially unremarkable. The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses. She has had no prior surgical procedures.,IMMUNIZATIONS:, Current and up to date.,ALLERGIES:, She has no known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: ,Currently taking no routine medications. She describes her pain level currently as zero.,FAMILY HISTORY:, There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter. This was done in Tijuana. His mom is from central portion of Mexico. There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,SOCIAL HISTORY: ,The patient is a junior at Hoover High School. She lives with her mom in Fresno.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress. She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,HEENT: The head and neck examination is most significant. There is mild amount of facial acne. The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,NECK: There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine. There are some shotty adenopathy in the area. No supraclavicular nodes were noted.,CHEST: Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,LUNGS: Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal. There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,ABDOMEN: Benign.,EXTREMITIES: Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,GENITOURINARY: External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia. This is same as too for her rectal examination.,SKIN: There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,NEUROLOGIC: Normal and no focal deficits. Her voice is strong and clear. There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:, I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range. T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal. Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative. There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable. A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed. There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:, The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary. The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease. During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy. We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation. We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well. I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them. I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit. This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy. The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case. I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity. All of the family's questions have been answered. This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family. I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done. We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.nan\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the location of the mass in the thyroid gland?\nWhat are other signs that she has with this disease?\nWhat does a total thyroidectomy entail?\nWhat does it mean if you need to have radiation treatment after surgery?\nHow is thyroiditis different from cancer?"}

{"prompt": "New Onset Seizure, REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, New-onset seizure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures. Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone. The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time. Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.

{"prompt": "Total Knee Replacement - 1, PROCEDURES:, Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:, The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh. Sterile prepping and draping proceeded. The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A midline incision was made, centered over the patella. Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally. Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues. The ACL and PCL were released. The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed. These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia. An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia. Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate. The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques. An anterior rough cut was made. The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed. The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment. Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made. The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made. The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit. A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes. Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked. The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again. The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau. A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made. The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia. The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension. Patellar width was checked with calipers. A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers. Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy. Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed. The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking. The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried. The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted. The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee. The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened. Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated. The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome. Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed. The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned. Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed. The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures. The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures. The skin was sealed with staples. Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.

This was an intraarticular four-part fracture that was displaced dorsally. In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptoms of carpal tunnel preop. She is admitted for reconstructive operation. The symptoms of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury.,OPERATION:, The patient was brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia. Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Tourniquet was placed around the right upper extremity. The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing. The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification. At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally. This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly. The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles. The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin. It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced. This was an intraarticular four-part fracture. Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced. Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. The fracture was then manipulated. The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it. Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment. A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires. At this time, the distal screws were then placed. The distal screws were the small screws. These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed. They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth. Again, these were 18-20 mm screws. After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires. There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture. After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit. The screws were then placed. These were 12 mm screws. They were placed 4 in number. The K-wires were then removed. Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist. This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure. It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation. The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed. The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm. In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon. Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline. Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery. The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion. A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position. The tourniquet was let down. The fingers were immediately pink.

Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2. Microdissection.,3. NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS: ,None.,FINDINGS:, There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall. There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis. There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus. The facial nerve was normal. We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty. The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure. There was no abnormal activity during this case. We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen. Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion. We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex. We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone. A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out. We went all the way to the mastoid antrum. We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus. We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip. We lowered the facial ridge. The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus. We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it. We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation. The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed. There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move. We carefully dissected this out. This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat. At this point, there was a near total perforation. There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left. We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place. He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage. We harvested a few pieces as best as we could. We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions. We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus. This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty. We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it. We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap. A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants. We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear. Glasscock dressing was applied.

A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: ,This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing. He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm. He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow. His parents' were both present preoperatively. His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region. Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible. He did have a radial pulse palpable.,PROCEDURE:, After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed.,The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner. Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly. Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out. The elbow was hyperflexed. Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve. The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm.,After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally. Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital. He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally. This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler. A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler. Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______. A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery. Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this. I then came back in and then we proceeded. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery. There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally. Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses.,We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed. The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position. He was splinted posteriorly. Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites. K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed.,Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above. There is concern for growth plate disturbance.

There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.,GROSS FINDINGS: ,Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,PROCEDURE: ,After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain. Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot. Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother. Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures. The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A bump was placed underneath the left buttock. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion. The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot. This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon. Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch. Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg. Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve. There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way. Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh. Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral. Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally. At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused. The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy. This was performed with a saw. After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi. The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader. A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area. Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy. It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly. A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline. The Achilles was repaired with this tie. Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening. A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl. The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case. The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's. Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril. The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.

The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen. The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact. Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY: ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain. She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella. She has failed conservative therapy. It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint. She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention. All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her. She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:, On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department. Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions. Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution. Intraoperative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris. Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal. An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal. A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. Next, the knee was suctioned dry. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee. The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery. The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision. The patellar tendon was identified. The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris. Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact. The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle. It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin. Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle. There was excellent fixation noted. The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees. She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length. The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella. The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl. Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.

Left hip arthroscopic labral repair.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:, The patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general anesthetic. His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table. His right leg was placed first. The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction. Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken. A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken. Gentle traction was applied. Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained. Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization. The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum. For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized. This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair. The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot. After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable. The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable. The posterior leg was stable. The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified. A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly. This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion. A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression. The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip. The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon. The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion. The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication. The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut. He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded. The tape was placed and his arms were well padded. He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region. We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space. We then marked the disc space. We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space. We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates. We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well. We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone. We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space. We then sized a 23-mm plate. We inserted the screws nicely above and below. We tightened down the lock-nuts. We irrigated the wound. We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate. We then assured hemostasis once again. We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion. The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy. A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3. Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate. We placed in self-retaining retractors. With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5. After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal. In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit. It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis. With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4. We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4. These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase. We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves. The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin. Blood loss was about 50 mL. No complication of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb. At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.

After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees. A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support. The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle. In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done. Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly. Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy. Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly. A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint. On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect. This was done under the microscope. A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus. A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level. This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen. Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released. Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right. This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots. With this done, the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation. Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites. Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed. A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7. The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7. With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down. A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site. Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.

{"prompt": "Total Knee Replacement - 1, PROCEDURES:, Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:, The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh. Sterile prepping and draping proceeded. The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A midline incision was made, centered over the patella. Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally. Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues. The ACL and PCL were released. The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed. These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia. An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia. Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate. The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques. An anterior rough cut was made. The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed. The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment. Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made. The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made. The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit. A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes. Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked. The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again. The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau. A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.

At that time, she was not actually contracting. She was Group B Streptococcus positive, however, was 5 cm dilated. The patient was started on Group B Streptococcus prophylaxis with ampicillin. She received a total of three doses throughout her labor. Her pregnancy was complicated by scanty prenatal care. She would frequently miss visits. At 37 weeks, she claims that she had a suspicious bump on her left labia. There was apparently no fluid or blistering of the lesion. Therefore, it was not cultured by the provider; however, the patient was sent for serum HSV antibody levels, which she tested positive for both HSV1 and HSV2. I performed a bright light exam and found no lesions anywhere on the vulva or in the vault as per sterile speculum exam and consulted with Dr. X, who agreed that since the patient seems to have no active lesion that she likely has had a primary outbreak in the past and it is safe to proceed with the vaginal delivery. The patient requested an epidural anesthetic, which she received with very good relief. She had IV Pitocin augmentation of labor and became completely dilated per my just routine exam just after 6 o'clock and was set up for delivery and the patient pushed very effectively for about one and a half contractions. She delivered a viable female infant on 12/27/2008 at 0626 hours delivering over an intact perineum. The baby delivered in the occiput anterior position.

The patient underwent a 2-day induction. On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress. During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration. Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication. There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery. It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay. The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day. The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns. The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.

{"prompt": "Skull Base Reconstruction, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,PROCEDURE:, Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion. The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen. The neck was prepped as well. After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl. A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle. After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible. The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared. The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen. The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen. The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis. A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use. I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb. It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube. The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made. I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion. Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy. For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap. A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm. The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath. Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle. The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin. The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction. The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion. The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel. The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges. The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck. The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique. Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes. Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well. There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline. The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax. The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl. I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place. The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with skin staples. There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself. The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06. The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius. Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis. It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial. Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation. Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery. Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection. There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord. This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma. There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis. This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair. The patient understood the risk of the surgery. I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring. The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case. After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support. Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region. All pressure points were padded. I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision. This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar. Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified. There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina. With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery. There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel. By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7. There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated. At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam. After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch. The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.nan\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the diagnosis?\nWhat is the procedure performed?\nWhat complications might occur postoperatively?\nIs there a procedural step that is particularly unusual or noteworthy?"}

The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation. Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull. A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome. The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion. Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle. We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this. We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface. Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance. We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid. This was submitted to pathology. We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology. They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor. It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed. We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially. We could see it through the ventricle. After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal. The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system. The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used for skin closure.

There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes. I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity. The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion. There was a roll beneath the right shoulder. The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint. Markings were applied. Sterile drapes were applied. A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. Weitlaner retractors were inserted. A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. The bone was set aside. The dura was clearly discolored and very tense. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade. There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. The margins of the membrane were coagulated. The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon. Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system. The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl. Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL. Sponge and needle counts were correct.,FINDINGS:, Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.,I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure. Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.neurosurgery, frontotemporal, weitlaner, calvarium, cookie cutter type, craniotomy, dura, frontotemporal craniotomy, galea, hematoma, subdural, subdural hematoma, syncopal, temporalis, subacute subdural hematoma, temporalis muscle,\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How is the patient's condition and diagnosis?\nWhat procedure are the surgeons performing on the patient?\nHow was the outcome of the surgery?\nWhat specific questions or concerns does an observer have about the surgery?"}
{"prompt": "Neuropsychological Evaluation - 2, REASON FOR REFERRAL: ,The patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.,BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:,RELEVANT HISTORY:,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with ,the patient.,The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope. She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope. The patient reports an extensive neurological history. Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient. In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved honors in school and looked smart. She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age. At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus. She reported that she will frequently bang her head against the wall to relieve the pain. The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age. At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches. She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and thrown two and a half city blocks. The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day. She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month. Her migraines became more severe following the head injury. In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights. Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion. These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep. She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused. These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008. When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator. She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes. A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day. She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist. Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal. She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG. She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized. She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and tunnel vision (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was spazzing out on the floor. During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old. She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel. She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt. In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication. At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself. The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory. She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes. She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential. She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform. She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions. She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued. At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college. The patient is living with her biological mother. Although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful. She reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them.,At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient's medication included Ativan, Imitrex, Levoxyl, vitamin B12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and Zofran as needed. (It should be noted that The patient by the time of the feedback on September 19, 2008 had resumed taking her Trileptal for bipolar disorder.).

He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:, After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room. He was placed in a supine position on the operating table. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll. Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace. The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered. The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure. The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid. Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis. The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated. A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed. There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity. The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored. The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus. It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area. The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair. After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French. These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures. The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position. A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced. The laparoscope was introduced. A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced. It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance. The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely. The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique. Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire. #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated. We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall. The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position. As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube. Sterile dressing was applied.

He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009. He had double vision. He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated. The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together. He still does not drive.

He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria. He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder. The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder. There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram was performed. Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side. At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire. The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities. The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire. The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance. The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction. The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed. A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation. The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system. Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system. The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass. Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed. The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis. The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room. It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy. He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.nephrology, renal mass, hematuria, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, cystourethroscopy, retrograde, pyelogram, ureteral pyeloscopy, renal biopsy, double-j, ureteral stent placement, ureteropelvic junction, flexible scope, papillary mass, ureteral stent, renal pelvis, ureteral orifice, amplatz wire, retrograde pyelogram, ureteral, cystoscope, ureteroscope, renal, bladder\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What did the doctor do?\nWhat is the surgical procedure?\nWhat is the diagnosis?\nWhat are the risks and side effects of this procedure?\nWhen will the patient feel good again?"}

His right flank was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. At this point, contrast was injected through his existing nephrostomy tube and there was no continuity with the collecting system and it was removed. The 5-French Pollack catheter was used to pass a 0.38 super-stiff Amplatz wire. The wire would not go down the ureter. Multiple attempts were made using Pollack catheters and Cobra catheters and attempts were made to dilate the track, both with rigid dilator and the balloon dilator and access could not be obtained. After multiple attempts, access was lost. At this point, the tubes were left out of the kidney and sterile dressings were applied. The patient was then placed on another operating table supine.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated. Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size. The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause. The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control. She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia. She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder. At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy. She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow. After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy. After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis. The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia. The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors. The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors. In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors. The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum. The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder. At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed. Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field. The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed. An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction. The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated. The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection. The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty. The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture. The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl. Good hemostasis was assured. The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl. Good hemostasis was obtained. Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline. The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel. This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation. Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament. A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline. The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments. The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline. The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted. The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff. The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline. Good support and hemostasis was noted. The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved. The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion. The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion. The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this. The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.

He also started having some abdominal pain; however, he continued about his regular activity until the other day when he passed out at home. His wife called paramedics and he was brought to the emergency room.,The patient has had a workup at this time which shows bilateral pulmonary infarcts. He has been started on heparin and we are asked to see him because of increasing BUN and creatinine.,The patient has no past history of any renal problems. He feels that he has been in good health until this current episode. His appetite has been good. He denies swelling in his feet or ankles. He denies chest pain. He denies any problems with bowel habits. He denies any unexplained weight loss. He denies any recent change in bowel habits or recent change in urinary habits.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: A gentleman seen who appears his stated age.,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 130/70.,CHEST: Chest expands equally bilaterally.

She has good flow, excellent physical exam, and now is ready for superficialization of the basilic vein. After discussing the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient preoperatively, the patient voiced understanding and signed informed consent.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the right arm was circumferentially prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. A longitudinal incision was made from just above the antecubital crease along the medial aspect of the arm overlying the palpable thrill using a 15 blade knife. The sharp dissection was then used to identify dissection created of the basilic vein from its surrounding tissues. This was continued and the incision was elongated up the arm as the vein was exposed in a serial fashion. Branch points were then taken down using multitude of techniques based upon the luminal diameter of the branch before transection. The basilic vein was ultimately freed in its entirety from just above the antecubital crease to the axilla at the level of the axillary vein. There was noted to be excellent flow through the vein. A pocket was then created just lateral to the incision in the subcutaneous tissue. The vein was then placed into this pocket securing with multiple interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bed of dissection of the basilic vein was then treated with fibrin sealant. The subcutaneous tissue was then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures in interrupted fashion. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl suture for a subcuticular stitch. Dermabond was applied to the incision. Again, there was noted to be good palpable thrill throughout the superficialized vein.

{"prompt": "Qualified Medical Evaluation Report, HISTORY OF INJURY AND PRESENT COMPLAINTS:, The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman. He is complaining chiefly of persistent lower back pain. He states the pain is of a rather constant nature. He describes it as a rather constant dull ache, sometimes rather sharp and stabbing in nature, most localized to the right side of his back more so than the left side of his lower back. He states he has difficulty with prolonged standing or sitting. He can only stand for about 5-10 minutes, then he has to sit down. He can only sit for about 15-20 minutes, he has to get up and move about because it exacerbates his back pain. He has difficulty with bending and stooping maneuvers. He describes an intermittent radiating pain down his right leg, down from the right gluteal hip area to the back of the thigh to the calf and the foot. He gets numbness along the lateral aspect of the foot itself. He also describes chronic pain complaints with associated tension in the back of his neck. He states the pain is of a constant nature in his neck. He states he gets pain that radiates into the right shoulder girdle area and the right forearm. He describes some numbness along the lateral aspect of the right forearm. He states he has trouble trying to use his arm at or above shoulder height. He has difficulty pushing, pulling, gripping, and grasping with the right upper extremity. He describes pain at the anterior aspect of his shoulder, in particular. He denies any headache complaints. He is relating his above complaints to two industrial injuries that he sustained while employed with Frito Lay Company as a truck driver or delivery person. He relates an initial injury that occurred on 06/29/1994, when apparently he was stepping out of the cab of his truck. He lost his footing and fell. He reached out to grab the hand railing. He fell backwards on his back and his right shoulder. He had immediate onset of shoulder pain, neck pain, and low back pain. He had pain into his right leg. He initially came under the care of Dr. H, an occupational physician in Modesto. Initially, he did not obtain any MRIs or x-rays. He did undergo some physical therapy and received some medications. Dr. H referred him to Dr. Q, a chiropractor for three visits, which the patient was not certain was very helpful. The patient advises he then changed treating physicians to Dr. N, D.C., whom he had seen previously for some back pain complaints back in 1990. He felt that the chiropractic care was helping his back, neck, and shoulder pain complaints somewhat. He continues with rather persistent pain in his right shoulder. He underwent an MRI of the right shoulder performed on 08/16/1994 which revealed prominent impingement with biceps tenosynovitis as well as supraspinatus tendonitis superimposed by a small pinhole tear of the rotator cuff. The patient was referred to Dr. P, an orthopedic surgeon who suggested some physical therapy for him and some antiinflammatories. He felt that the patient might require a cortisone injection or possibly a surgical intervention. The patient also underwent an MRI of the cervical spine on 08/03/1994, which again revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease in his neck. There is some suggestion of bilateral neuroforaminal encroachment due to degenerative changes and disc bulges, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 levels. The patient was also seen by Dr. P, a neurologist for a Neurology consult. It is unclear to me as to whether or not Dr. P had performed an EMG or nerve conduction studies of his upper or lower extremities. The patient was off work for approximately six months following his initial injury date that occurred on 06/29/1994. He returned back to regular duty. Dr. N declared him permanent and stationary on 04/04/1995. The patient then had a recurrence or flare-up or possibly new injury, again, particularly to his lower back while working for Frito Lay on 03/29/1997, when he was loading some pallets on the back of a trailer. At that time, he returned to see Dr. N for chiropractic care, who is his primary treating physician. Dr. N took him off work again. He was off work again for approximately another six months, during which time, he was seen by Dr. M, M.D., a neurosurgeon. He had a new MRI of his lumbar spine performed. The MRI was performed on 05/20/1997. It revealed L4-5 disc space narrowing with prominent disc bulge with some mild spinal stenosis. The radiologist had noted he had a prior disc herniation at this level with some improvement from prior exam. Dr. M saw him on 09/18/1997 and noted that there was some improvement in his disc herniation at the L4-5 level following a more recent MRI exam of 05/20/1997, from previous MRI exam of 1996 which revealed a rather prominent right-sided L4-5 disc herniation. Dr. M felt that there was no indication for a lumbar spine surgery, but he mentioned with regards to his cervical spine, he felt that EMG studies of the right upper extremity should be obtained and he may require a repeat MRI of the cervical spine, if the study was positive. The patient did undergo some nerve conduction studies of his lower extremities with Dr. K, M.D., which suggested a possible abnormal EMG with evidence of possible L5 radiculopathy, both right and left. Unfortunately, I had no medical reports from Dr. P suggesting that he may have performed nerve conduction studies or EMGs of the upper and lower extremities. The patient did see Dr. R for a neurosurgical consult. Dr. R evaluated both his neck and lower back pain complaints on several occasions. Dr. R suggested that the patient try some cervical epidural steroid injections and lumbar selective nerve root blocks. The patient underwent these injections with Dr. K. The patient reported only very slight relief temporarily with regards to his back and leg symptoms following the injections. It is not clear from the medical record review whether the patient ever had a cervical epidural steroid injection; it appears that he had some selective nerve root blocks performed in the lumbar spine. Dr. R on 12/15/2004 suggested that the patient had an MRI of the cervical spine revealing a right-sided C5-6 herniated nucleus pulposus which would explain his C-6 distribution numbness. The patient also was noted to have a C4-5 with rather severe degenerative disc disease. He felt the patient might be a candidate for a two-level ACDF at C4-5 and C5-6. Dr. R in another report of 08/11/2004 suggested that the patient's MRI of 05/25/2004 of the lumbar spine reveals multilevel degenerative disc disease. He had an L4-5 slight anterior spondylolisthesis, this may be a transitional vertebrae at the L6 level as well, with lumbarization of S1. He felt that his examination suggested a possible right S1 radiculopathy with discogenic back pain. He would suggest right-sided S1 selective nerve root blocks to see if this would be helpful; if not, he might be a candidate for a lumbar spine fusion, possibly a Dynesys or a fusion or some major spine surgery to help resolve his situation., ,The patient relates that he really prefers a more conservative approach of treatment regarding his neck, back, and right shoulder symptoms. He continued to elect chiropractic care which he has found helpful, but apparently the insurance carrier is no longer authorizing chiropractic care for him. He is currently taking no medications to manage his pain complaints. He states regarding his work status, he was off work again for another six months following the 03/29/1997 injury. He returned back to work and continued to work regular duty up until about a year ago, at which time, he was taken back off work again and placed on TTD status by Dr. N, his primary treating physician. The patient states he has not been back to work since. He has since applied for social security disability and now is receiving social security disability benefits. The patient states he has tried some Myox therapy with Dr. H on 10 sessions, which he found somewhat helpful. Overall, the patient does not feel that he could return back to his usual and customary work capacity as a delivery driver for Frito Lay.,nan\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is the patient experiencing any headache pain?\nWhat does he mean by 'intermittent radiating pain down his right leg'?\nIs he able to walk without pain?\nCan he drive or use his right arm?\nWhat is the doctor suggesting about a two-level ACDF for C4 and C5?"}

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed. SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol. The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion. At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery. The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site. Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules. An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion. The effusion was then drained with a sucker. Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura. Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease. This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization. After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc. The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.

The pathology showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma Nottingham grade II. The tumor was ER positive, PR positive and HER-2/neu negative. On 02/22/08, she underwent a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathology showed a 3.3 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade I, one sentinel lymph node was negative.

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2. Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:, None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:, Patient brought to the operating room. After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff. Routine prep and drape was employed. Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet. Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder. A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made. Skin was sharply incised. Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery. Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches. Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery. Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection. This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule. This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window. After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture. Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision. An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made. Skin was sharply incised. Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve. Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum. This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment. EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury. The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone. Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified. This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen. Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis. Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer. Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur. Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained. Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided. Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided. The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS. Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia. A bulky gently compressive wrist and forearm bandage incorporating an EBI cooling pad were applied. Tourniquet was deflated.

A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach. A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum. Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field. The left testicle was examined. A large spermatocele was noted. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele. Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis. Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis. Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord. The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors. Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends. Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position. The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic. Attention was then turned to the right side. The vas was palpated in the scrotum. A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field. A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat. Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery. Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum. A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision. Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.

She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything. She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE:, Informed consent was obtained from patient. The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed. Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks. Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg. The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus. There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus. This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots. The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation. Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation. Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net. Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft. Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out. Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully. The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy. No active bleeding was seen. There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach. As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION:, Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.

The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped. Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around. We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction. A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle. It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures. The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips. The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications. It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest.surgery, ventriculoatrial shunt, endoscopic proximal shunt revision, endoscopic proximal shunt, portnoy ventricular catheter, shunt malfunction, shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt, endoscopic, ventricular, proximal, catheter,\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the diagnosis of the patient?\nWhat complications occurred for the patient?\nWhat devices were used during the operation?\nWhat surgical procedure was performed and what did it entail?"}

The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula. Recommendation for a surgery was made. The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter. They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure. All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:, The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic. An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia. The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall. At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad. The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen. The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation. At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess. When the small bowel was completely freed of abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus. The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized. At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum. At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed. Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired. The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology. Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis. A pursestring device was fired. The staple line was cut. The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied. At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced. The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient. ,Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom. It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches. Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air. No air was seen evolving from the staple line. All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken. The scope was removed at this point. The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula. Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon. After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again. More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area. The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin. The wire was passed under the transverse colon. It was left in place. Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis. At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied. Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue. Copious amount of irrigation was used. The skin was approximated with staples. At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made. The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge. One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened. As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture. The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well. At this point, dressings were applied.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion. Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution. A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon. This could later be removed in bishop. A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished. A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock. Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation. Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus. An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament. The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain. Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified. Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement. A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani. The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well. The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse. The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured. The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation. A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston. The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen. It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate. The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate. A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus. Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position. Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph. A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction. The mobility appeared excellent. The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position. The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.

The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease. Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed. The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others. The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table. The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube. The eyes were protected with Tegaderm. The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon. The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine. Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately. A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip. The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised. A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected. A shoulder roll was applied. The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly. Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left. Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible. The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve. Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric. The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally. The mylohyoid muscle appreciated. The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated. The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis. The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure. Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side. Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified. The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified. The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels. Attention was then turned to the central neck. The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline. There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature. A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed. Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side. This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein. Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass. Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis. Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection. A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius. The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly. Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland. A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated. The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly. Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified. The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle. Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex. Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization. The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass. Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated. The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly. The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base. The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein. The wound was copiously irrigated. Valsalva maneuver was given. No bleeding points identified. The wound was then prepared for closure. Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon. The wound was closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.

Anemia of chronic disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE: ,The patient was admitted through the emergency room. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. He was rewarmed and had blood, sputum, and urine cultures done. He was placed on IV Rocephin. His usual medications of Dilantin and Depakene were given. The patient's hypertension was treated with fluid boluses. The patient was empirically placed on Synthroid and hydrocortisone by Dr. X. Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins. H&H was stable at 33.3/10.9 and platelets of 80,000. White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal. TSH was 3.41. Free T4 was 0.9. Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement. A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone. This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level. Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef. The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The patient was started back on his tube feeds. He tolerated these poorly with residuals. Reglan was increased to 10 mg q.6 h. and erythromycin is being added. The patient's temperature has been stable in the 94 to 95 range. Other vital signs have been stable. His urine output has been diminished. An external jugular line was placed in the Intensive Care Unit. The patient's legal guardian, Janet Sanchez in Albuquerque has requested he be transported there.

{"prompt": "Discharge Summary - ATV Accident, ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:, Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:, Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:, None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008. Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident. He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters. The patient denies any loss of consciousness. He was not amnestic to the event. He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated. Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE:, Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture. No other apparent injuries. This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment. The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture. The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture. In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture. In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures. Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse. The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture. A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring. His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication. The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident. A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point. Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed. The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed. His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound. He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor. Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries. However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity. Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia. There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion. There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand. By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well. He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies. He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1. Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2. Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3. Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.

Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy. She did use insulin at that time as well. She does not fully understand what ketones are. She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way. She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:, Weight is 238.3 pounds. Weight from last week\u2019s visit was 238.9 pounds. Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds. Height is 62-3/4 inches. Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2. Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time. Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following: Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116. Overall average is 140. A diet history was obtained. Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005. Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes. A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed. The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:, Patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day. Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day. Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks. The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine. We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most. We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget. We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy. We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars. While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient\u2019s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day. Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis. At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:, Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate. Breakfast: Three carbohydrate servings. Morning snack: One carbohydrate serving. Lunch: Four carbohydrate servings. Afternoon snack: One carbohydrate serving. Supper: Four carbohydrate servings. Bedtime snack: One carbohydrate serving. Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack. Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals. Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack. Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment: Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.

{"prompt": "Carbohydrate Counting, SUBJECTIVE:, This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes. The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA. She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477. She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog. Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump. Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day. She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold. She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:, Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper. Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours. A diet history was obtained. I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended. A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended. The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed. Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:, The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall. It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio. We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents. We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources. She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated. We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals. With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner. Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately. The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:, Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.

{"prompt": "Prostatectomy, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive.,PROCEDURE DONE:, Open radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection.,INDICATIONS:, This is a 66-year-old gentleman who had an elevated PSA of 5. His previous PSAs were in the 1 range. TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden. After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy. Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision. The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room here. Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was placed in the supine position. The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area. The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes. The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field. Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision. A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus. Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle. Space of rectus sheath was then entered. The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area. The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected. This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein. Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall. The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally. Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves. An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated. The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation. The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad. The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia. The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments. Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders. A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle. A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis. Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide. Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter. The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra. The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end. The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end. The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety. A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex. The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut. Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue. Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal. Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete. Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia. The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip. Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters. The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate. Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity. Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation. The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion. The rest of the mucosa was then everted. The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure. At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position. Hemostasis was then adequately obtained. FloSeal was applied to the pelvis. The bladder was then irrigated. It was draining pink urine. The wound was copiously irrigated. The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS. The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications. The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU. Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted. This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.surgery, bilateral lymph node dissection, retropubic prostatectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, gleason score, prostate cancer, trus, biopsy, bilateral lymph node, lymph node dissection, catheter was inserted, bilateral lymph, node dissection, vicryl stitch, prostatic pedicles, pelvic veins, external iliac, iliac vein, seminal vesicle, lymph node, foley catheter, dorsal venous, venous complex, bladder neck, dissection, prostatectomy, bladder, endopelvic, vicryl, catheter, vein, venous, fascia, dorsal, urethra,\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What was the prostatectomy procedure?\nHow does it compare to a radical retropubic prostatectomy?\nWhat is Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive?\nDoes the patient have prostate cancer?"}

He knows what needs to be done with the absence of carbohydrates, and especially simple sugar. He will also check a hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, urine for microalbuminuria and a chem profile. I will need to recheck him in a month to verify that his sugars and blood pressure have come into the ideal range. He has allergic rhinitis for which Zyrtec can be used.,2. He has irritable bowel syndrome. We will use Metamucil for that which also should help stabilize the stools so that the irritation of the rectum is lessened. For the bleeding I would like to obtain a sigmoidoscopy. It is bright red blood.,3. For his insomnia, I found there is very little in the way of medications that are going to fix that, however I have encouraged him in good sleep hygiene. I will look forward to seeing him back in a month. I will call him with the results of his lab. His medications were made out. We will use some Elocon cream for his seborrheic dermatitis of the face. Zyrtec and Flonase for his allergic rhinitis.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How does the patient's health affect his work capacity?\nAre there any negative side effects of the medications?\nWhen was the patient last checked for diabetes and hypertension?\nHow is the insomnia affecting quality of life and productivity?"}

Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion. A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe. A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field. A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position. A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife. A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus. The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion. Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed. Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber. A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision. A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants. Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag. The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power. I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag. A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber. The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm. The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag. The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A. Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision. The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera. The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.

The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together. He still does not drive. He also is not working due to the double vision. There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision. More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.

Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department. He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side. MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative. He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal. His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis. He had left gaze diplopia. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal. According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil. There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.

Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars. She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart. Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency. She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals. She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home. She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day. She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:, Today's weight: 155.5 pounds. Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds. A diet history was obtained.

Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day. Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns. In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m. We discussed the need for small frequent eating. We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response. We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her. The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars. In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice. We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time. Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake. Her weight loss was discouraged. Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:, The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan. The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day. The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time. The meal plan is as follows: breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings. Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep. Encouraged adequate rest. Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.

Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day. Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks. The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine. We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most. We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget. We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy. We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars. While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient\u2019s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day. Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis. At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:, Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate. Breakfast: Three carbohydrate servings. Morning snack: One carbohydrate serving. Lunch: Four carbohydrate servings. Afternoon snack: One carbohydrate serving. Supper: Four carbohydrate servings.

{"prompt": "Chest Pain - Cardiac Consult, REASON FOR REFERRAL:, Chest pain, possible syncopal spells.,She is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with ADD.,She was doing okay until January of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy. Since then she just says things have changed . She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same. Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband. Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.,In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel like cramps and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long. She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand. She has also had three spells of falling, she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes. Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store. She suffered no trauma. She has no remote history of syncope.

Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal. I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good. I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night. I think this should take care of the problem. I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.,2.

{"prompt": "Cervical Cord Lesion - Consult, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this.,He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was rebuilt. He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair.,MEDICATIONS:, His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, natural potassium, Starlix and the aspirin.,ALLERGIES:, HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile.,MENTAL STATUS: He is alert.,CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline.,NECK: His neck was supple.,MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left.,CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular.,BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly.,RADIOLOGIC DATA:, MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis.,LABORATORY: ,His initial labs were unremarkable.,IMPRESSION: ,Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion.,PLAN:, Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture.

After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin. She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting. In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today. On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X.

{"prompt": "Bladder Instillation, CHIEF COMPLAINT:, The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.,SUBJECTIVE:, The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort. These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her. She feels anxious and worried. She does not think she can take any more pain. She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help. They seem to be intensifying her pain. She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine. So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her. We discussed this at length. I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide. She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality. She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS:, Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:, Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs: Weight: 140 pounds. Blood pressure: 132/90. Pulse: 102. Respirations: 18. Age: 27.,PLAN:, We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion. She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete. The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back. As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her. She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today\u2019s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday\u2019s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend. I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,: She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine. We waited about 20 minutes. The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed. The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder. She seemed to tolerate it moderately well. She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it. If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.consult - history and phy., urethra, dmso, bladder, chronic interstitial cystitis, interstitial cystitis, bladder instillation, instillation, instillations,\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the treatment modality for chronic interstitial cystitis?\nWhat is happening to the patient, as she cries throughout this appointment?\nWhy does the patient need to have a bladder instillation?\nWhat is causing the patient's pain?\nWhat will happen if the next two appointments are canceled due to discomfort?"}

He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007. When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain. He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase. He is taking multiple other pain medications. The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, He has had diabetes since 2003.

He also has a longstanding history of neck pain. His neurological examination is normal. He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes. I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal. We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.,2.

It is overall a Class-II indication for permanent pacemaker insertion.,PROCEDURE:, The risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure were all discussed with the patient and the patient's family in detail at great length. Overall options and precautions of the pacemaker and indications were all discussed. They agreed to the pacemaker. The consent was signed and placed in the chart. The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, where she was monitored throughout the whole procedure. The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner for permanent pacemaker insertion. Myself and Dr. Wildes spoke for approximately 8 minutes before insertion for the procedure. Using a lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left subclavian vein and left pectodeltoid region was anesthetized locally.,IV sedation, increments, and analgesics were given. Using a #18 gauge needle, the left subclavian vein access was cannulated without difficulty. A guidewire was then passed through the Cook needle and the Cook needle was then removed. The wire was secured in place with the hemostat. Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectoral deltoid region where the skin was dissected and blunted down into the pectoris major muscle fascia. The skin was then undermined used to make a pocket for the pacemaker. The guidewire was then tunneled through the pacer pocket. Cordis sheath was then inserted through the guidewire. The guidewire and dilator were removed. ___ cordis sheath was in placed within. This was used for insertion of the ventricular screw and steroid diluted leads where under fluoroscopy. It was placed into the apex. Cordis sheath was then split apart and removed and after the ventricular lead was placed in its appropriate position and good thresholds were obtained, the lead was then sutured in place with #1-0 silk suture to the pectoris major muscle. The lead was then connected on pulse generator. The pocket was then irrigated and cleansed. Pulse generator and the wire was then inserted into the ____ pocket.

Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins. A median sternotomy incision was performed. Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw. A subtotal thymectomy was performed. Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle. A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure. Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right. Atrial appendage. The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula. With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie. Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed and iced and systemic steroids were administered. During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle. After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping. Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula. The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed. It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed. The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture. Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir. A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest. The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture. The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures. The venous cannula was reinserted. Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released. The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm. Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains. Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate. All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic. With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed. SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol. The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion. At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery. The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site. Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules. An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion. The effusion was then drained with a sucker. Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura. Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease. This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.

She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass. Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:, Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall. The spleen and liver were unremarkable. The gallbladder was surgically absent.,There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized. There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses. The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:, After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table. The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.,Prep was performed. Sterile drapes were applied. Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left. Laparoscopy was performed with ___________. At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port. Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.,At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed. We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.,At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia. Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen. The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction. After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland. We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected. There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected. Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.,At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis. Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings. The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.,The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding. The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected. There was no evidence of bleeding.,At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: ,The patient is a 23-year-old gentleman who was involved in a crush injury to his right wrist. He was placed into a well-molded splint after reduction was performed in the emergency department. Further x-rays showed further distal fragment dorsal angulation that progressively worsened and it was felt that surgical intervention was warranted. All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of the surgery were explained to the patient in detail, and he signed the informed consent for ORIF of the right wrist.,PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operative table. The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well. The right upper extremity had a well-padded tourniquet placed on the right arm, which was insufflated and maintained for 40 minutes at 250 mmHg pressure. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 5-cm incision was made over the flexor carpi radialis of the right wrist. The skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the deep tissue was retracted, blunt dissection was performed down to the pronator quadratus. Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue. Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment. This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position. An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius. This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment. A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position. Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself. The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular. Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate. All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture. AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again. None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex. Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase. AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws. Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint. The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint.

{"prompt": "Cardiac Consult & Cardioversion, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter, who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10/09, and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged. He, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on Coumadin.,The patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead EKG here. Otherwise, no chest pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide. He completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia. Other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia.,MEDICATIONS:,As outpatient,,1. Atenolol 25 mg once a day.,2. Altace 2.5 mg once a day.,3. Zocor 20 mg once a day.,4. Flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.,5. Coumadin as directed by our office.,ALLERGIES:, TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE. HE DENIES SHRIMP, SEA FOOD OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY:, He has a nephew who was his sister's son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an MI, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well. The patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, Dr. X, at General Hospital and it sounds like he had a negative EP study.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine. No use of illicit drugs. He has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today's cardiology consultation by his wife. He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish. He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi. There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM:, Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18. On general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress. HEENT: Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. He has moist mucosal membranes. Neck veins are not distended.

Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:, Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION:, Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so. I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of. After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null. The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis. I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE: ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions. The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure. After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using lollipop posterior patch with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy. There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION:, Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22. We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed. I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself. Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.nan\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is happening in the body physically to cause the disruption of atrial fibrillation?\nWhat diagnoses does the patient have and what are his risks if he were to be cardioverted?\nWhat are the alternatives to cardioversion and why was not it recommended as an option for this patient?\nHow often does the patient experience atrial fibrillation or a recurrence of it?"}
{"prompt": "Angina - Consult, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina. In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her. I advised her to call 911, which she did. While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY:, The patient has been having arm pain for several months. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker. However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room. On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80% mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area. The decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel. She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08. She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild. Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin. This is her usual angina. She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.

In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy. We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already. Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc. I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion. I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect. My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function. She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.

Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1. Infection.,2. Bleeding.,3. Incontinence.,4. Impotence.,5. Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6. Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade. The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie. Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was then placed. The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors. Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion. With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra could then be easily identified. Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors. This exposed the blue Foley catheter. Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture. Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. The Foley catheter was then removed. This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. This was developed without any difficulty. Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. The tip was left behind. Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. This was performed on the left side and then the right side. This completely freed the prostate. The prostate was sent for permanent section. The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. This was performed by using a French ***** needle. A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon. The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region. All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure. The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.

After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue. The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly. The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space. A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection. The right lower lobe was identified. There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not. Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe. Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected. The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected. Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected. The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis. The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free. The mediastinum was then explored. No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus. Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips. The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected. Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery. All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen. Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated. Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures. Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches.

The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia with a Foley catheter in place and she was prepped and draped in the usual manner. A low abdominal transverse skin incision was constructed and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the anterior rectus fascia. Bleeding points were snapped and coagulated along the way. The fascia was opened transversally and was dissected sharply and bluntly from the underlying rectus muscles. These were divided in the midline revealing the peritoneum, which was opened vertically. The uterus was in mid position. The bladder flap was incised elliptically and reflected caudad. A low transverse hysterotomy incision was then constructed and extended bluntly. Amniotomy revealed clear amniotic fluid. A live born vigorous male infant was then delivered from the right occiput transverse position. The infant breathed and cried spontaneously. The nares and pharynx were suctioned. The umbilical cord was clamped and divided and the infant was passed to the waiting neonatal team. Cord blood samples were obtained. The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was eventrated for closure. The edges of the uterine incision were grasped with Pennington clamps and closure was carried out in standard two-layer technique using 0 Vicryl suture with the second layer imbricating the first. Hemostasis was completed with an additional figure-of-eight suture of 0 Vicryl. The cornual sac and gutters were irrigated. The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.

Liposuction of the supraumbilical abdomen.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:, The patient is a 31-year-old white female who previously has undergone latissimus dorsi flap and implant, breast reconstruction. She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction. It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length. The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected. She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such. The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail. The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed. She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear. At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached. This was then opened. The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution. Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast. The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form. The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant. The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness. With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed. A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed. The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures. The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture. Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours. This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture. The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus. A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area. A compressive garment was placed.

The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain. Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle. Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed. Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis. The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed. The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made. There was very, very thick scrotal skin. There was no necrotic skin. As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum. The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus. The pus just poured out of the left testicle. The left testicle was completely removed. Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue. Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum. There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum. I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal. So, the right hemiscrotum was opened. The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick. The testicle appeared normal. There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum. At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress. There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.

The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin. He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago. The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103. He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant. He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother. I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis. The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, The patient has no known allergies. He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery. Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions. No other hospitalizations. He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned. He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient lives with both parents and no siblings. There are smokers at home.,MEDICATIONS:, Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment. Also Bactrim.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Weight is 14.9 kg.,GENERAL: The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.,HEAD AND NECK: Grossly normal. His neck and chest are without masses.,NARES: He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.,LUNGS: Clear.,CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN: Soft without masses or tenderness.,GU: He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema. There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection. He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans. The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness. Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact.,BACK: Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:, The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis. This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities. I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad. I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day. I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely. Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.

A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion. Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic. The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff. This was nondominant. Several catheters were used. Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used. A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve. Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast. Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve. Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results. There were no complications. He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1. Right coronary artery: This has an unusual high anterior takeoff.

She also has a septal deviation mid posterior to the left compromising greater than 70% of her nasal airway.,PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the skin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum. Approximately 10 cc total was used.,A #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision. A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator. The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps. The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest. The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.,Attention then was directed toward the left side. Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps. Approximately 10 cc total was used. The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better. The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps. Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site. The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.,The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection. Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also. The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy. The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver. The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it. It was not desirable to remove it in its entirety. Any obvious bleeding points along the edge were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.,The same procedure and findings were noted on the right side with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine injected into the anterior portion of the right middle turbinate, polyps, and uncinate process; 10 cc total were used. The polyps were removed. The Richards essential shaver was used to allow better exposure of the uncinate process. The uncinate process was removed superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting side-biting forceps.,Next, a maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting and side-biting forceps and showed all plate accumulations there also. The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered primarily and dissected with Richards essential shaver followed by the use of the 30-degree scope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral resection. The inferior turbinates showed mucosal disease, polypoid accumulations, and changes. These were removed using the Richards essential shaver followed by a submucosal resection of the hypertrophied portion of the turbinate.,Any obvious bleeding points were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus. A thorough irrigation was then carried out in the nasal cavity, and Gelfilm packing was used to coat the linings in the middle meatal regions.

After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.,PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated. The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum. There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation. The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Air was aspirated. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed. There was no evidence of perianal disease. No source of the anemia was identified.,Attention was then taken for performing an EGD. The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx. The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed. There were no abnormalities of the esophagus. The stomach was entered and was insufflated. The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum. Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______. It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm. Several biopsies were taken. The mass was soft. The pylorus was then entered. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined. There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding. The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed. In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation. There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps. Biopsy was also taken for CLO. A hiatal hernia was present as well. Air was aspirated. The scope was slowly withdrawn. The GE junction was unremarkable. The scope was fully withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.

He contacted myself and stated that Angelica was going to have her wisdom teeth extracted in the setting of a hospital operating room at Hospital and he inquired if we could pair on the procedure and I could do her full mouth dental rehabilitation before the wisdom teeth were removed by him. I agreed. I saw her in my office and she was cooperative for full mouth set of radiographs in my office and a clinical examination. This clinical and radiographic examination revealed no dental caries; however, she was in need of a good dental cleaning.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION: ,The patient was brought to Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by her mother. I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment. After all their questions and concerns were addressed, they gave their informed consent to proceed with the treatment. The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed. Once she was cleared by Anesthesia, she was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected. Anesthesia was induced by mask. The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized. The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection. An Angiocath was previously placed in preop. The head and neck were draped in sterile towels, and the body was covered with lead apron and sterile sheath. A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars. Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed. Preoperative digital intraoral photographs were taken. No digital radiographs were taken in the operating room, as I stated before I had a full set of digital radiographs taken in my office. A prophylaxis was then performed using a Prophy cup and fluoridated Prophy paste after scaling and replaning was done. She presented with moderate calculus on the buccal surfaces of her maxillary, first molars and lower molars. She did not require any restorative dentistry.,Upon the conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris. The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided. Postoperative clinical photographs were taken. The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction and visualization. Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS:, This patient presented in her permanent dentition.

{"prompt": "Craniotomy - Frontotemporal - 1, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Acute left subdural hematoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Acute left subdural hematoma.,PROCEDURE:, Left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, This is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia. He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency. He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury. His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia. He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy. The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition. He was fixed in a three-point headrest. His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol. We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region. The scalp was reflected. A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created. After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain. The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up. We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline. After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline. We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates. The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment. Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.

She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.,Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor. We marked external landmarks. Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area. This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.,Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.,A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline. This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips. The skin flap was retracted medially. Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected. One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap. Hemostasis was obtained. Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was. The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus. We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain. The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.,We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.,Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor. Subsequently, we entered the tumor. The tumor itself was extremely hard. Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.,We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.,Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case. We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.,Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor. Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely. In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out. We resected the entire tumor. Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.,Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam. We also lined the cavity with Surgicel. The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.,The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion. Surgicel was placed over the dural closure. The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators. The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples. The wound was dressed. The patient was returned to the intensive care unit. She was awake and moving extremities well. No apparent complications were noted.

She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes. She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:, The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail. She provided her consent. The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl. A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure. This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided. In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure. While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk. For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure. She was noted to have some pools of stool. This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes. Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself. It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum. However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome. The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:, She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.

Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: \"If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.\"\n\nThe committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was \"fit for purpose\", describing it as \"a failing organisation\" and \"in crisis\" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the \"abandonment option\", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.\n\nAnd responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. \"But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work.\"\n\nThe MPs launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up.

The Vantage is \"the most important car in the history of our company\", said Aston's chief executive Ulrich Bez. Aston - whose cars were famously used by James Bond - will unveil the Vantage at the Geneva Motor Show on Thursday.

Development costs for the Vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with Aston's DB9, which Mr Bez described as \"the previous most important car for our company\".

{"prompt": "MPs' murder sentence concern\n\nMurder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new MPs' report.\n\nThe influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. The MPs also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.\n\n\"The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor.\" At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. But although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. In July this year Amanda Champion's killer, James Ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.\n\nAmanda's uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: \"Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence.\" MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.\n\nThe measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.\n\nAs a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to \"remove ambiguity\" over how murderers should be sentenced. It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. The committee said the plans had not reflected the \"public disquiet\" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. Lord Woolf's Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. As a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.\n\nMr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliament's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. He said: \"We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances.\" But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals. He said: \"By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. \"We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial.\"\n\nShadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. \"There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,\" he said. But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned the MPs' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. \"The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different,\" he told BBC News.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Does the committee feel that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor?\nWhy would a judge or magistrate give a murderer a reduced sentence for pleading guilty?\nWhat are the concerns of Amanda's uncle, Lewis Champion, and shadow home secretary David Davis over this issue?\nWhy did the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) propose reduced sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime?\nDoes the Home Office stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial?\nWhat is Mr Denham hoping to see from the SGC on this issue?\nWhat does Mr Denham believe will happen if judges are bound too much by prescriptive approaches in sentencing people convicted of crimes like murder?"}
{"prompt": "School sport 'is back', says PM\n\nTony Blair has promised that \"sport is back\" as a priority for schools.\n\nThe prime minister launched a \u00a3500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. \"It's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,\" Mr Blair said. But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.\n\nThe latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options. Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London. He said: \"You've got to bring back school sport. It's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. It's still very, very important.\"\n\nEarlier, Education Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed \"a coherent framework\" and \"dedicated funding\". These were training for PE teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. He added the government had originally pledged \"for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education\" a week. The proportion was currently at 62%, and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. The money for the initiative will come from a new \u00a3500m fund.\n\nThe \u00a3500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. Shadow spokesman for sport Hugh Robertson said: \"I suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.\" He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an \"anti-competitive sport agenda\" had been pursued in recent years.

Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large. The Culture Secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.\n\nBut Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a \"shambles\". \"This announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government. \"Instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill, to liberalise the rules governing gambling, the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present.\" Shares in British casino operators London Clubs International, Rank Group and Stanley Leisure, who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos, fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement. Ms Jowell's deputy, Richard Caborn, said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue, and responded to the concerns raised. \"Limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling,\" he said. \"We also believe it's right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos.\"\n\nHe added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas. Church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos. Salvation Army spokesman Jonathan Lomax said: \"The proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period, which we think should last at least five years, will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling.\" But British British Casino Association Chairman Penny Cobham said her members were \"outraged\" by the decision, which followed a campaign in the Daily Mail newspaper. \"There was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos.

But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. Labour MPs have warned against disunity and Tory leader Michael Howard may well take up the theme in the Commons. The Tories have already accused the prime minister and his chancellor of behaving like \"schoolboys squabbling in a playground\".\n\nMichael Howard is likely to want to capitalise further on the spat when he goes head-to-head with the prime minister in the Commons.

Mr Brown, meanwhile, is visiting Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya to highlight the plight of many Africans hit by Aids, war and famine - issues which Mr Blair has also spoken out on.

But the percentage of poorer students \"hardly changed at all\", said its chief executive, Sir Howard Newby. Increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.\n\nThe Hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. Participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in Kensington and Chelsea, 65% in the City of London and Westminster and 62% in Sheffield Hallam, down to 10% in Bristol South and Leeds Central and 8% in Nottingham North and Sheffield Brightside.\n\nSir Howard said the report highlighted the \"entrenched divisions\" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. He told BBC News: \"We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. In fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. \"The issue is, I think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people.\"\n\nHe said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.\n\nTuition fees and student loans in England and Wales - and the different fee regime in Scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994. In the poorest areas, the gap was 30% in women's favour and growing faster than anywhere else. The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: \"We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.\" Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. From 2006 upfront tuition fees in England would be removed, with grants for the less well off. The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: \"It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. \"Tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access.\" The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. The National Union of Students argued the opposite - that the situation was \"likely to get much worse, with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration\".\n\nThe tables below show the participation rate for each Parliamentary constituency in Britain:\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why are those from more well-off backgrounds six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas?\nWhy do teenagers in the richest areas have an expected chance of 50% of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods, it is 10%?\nWhat are some other reasons for why teens from poorer backgrounds are less likely to go to university?\nIs a gap of 30% in women's favour significant or just something else we should be concerned about when looking at inequalities and education?\nShould universities deal with pupils before age 16 or wait until they're 18 years old and attending a secondary school where there are higher standards?\nWhat does \"earlier\" mean in relation to children from disadvantaged areas being persuaded that \"university is something for them too\"?\nHow would deferred tuition fees, grants, and bursaries for poorer students encourage more students from disadvantaged areas to go into higher education?"}

{"prompt": "Blair 'said he would stand down'\n\nTony Blair promised Gordon Brown he would stand down before the next election, a new book about the chancellor claims.\n\nBut the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the Cabinet, according to the book. The book by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other. The book, Brown's Britain, said Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters' trust.\n\nThe author's sources, all unnamed \"allies\" of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, said the prime minister felt the Iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party.\n\nThe book, serialised in the Sunday Telegraph, alleges that Mr Blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy PM John Prescott in November 2003 of his intention to stand down. \"At that stage he saw Gordon Brown and said, 'look you are the next most influential member of the government, I need your help to get through the next year,\" Mr Peston said. \"I myself recognise that I'm going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.'\" But he changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims.\n\nMr Peston told BBC News: \"My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. \"What the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. \"I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I don't think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.\" There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. Rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold Mr Blair's monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa.

He said the prime minister should sack Mr Brown, but did not believe Mr Blair was strong enough to do so. Conservative policy co-ordinator David Cameron, MP for Witney, added: \"If it wasn't so serious it would be funny. \"But it is serious - you've got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime, poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other.\" Carol Walker, BBC News 24 political correspondent, added: \"There is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign. \"And clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What was Tony Blair's intention when he said to Gordon Brown in 2003 \"I'm going to have to stand down before the election\"?\nWhen did Tony Blair change his mind?\nIs there animosity and mistrust between them?\nWhat effect could this have on the upcoming election?"}
{"prompt": "How political squabbles snowball\n\nIt's become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.\n\nBut this analysis in fact gets it wrong. It's not just children who fight - adults do too. And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.\n\nEach participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.) Now this isn't because the participants are stupid - it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them. Indeed, there's even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. Nothing as obscure as \"post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory\" which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.\n\nIt's often referred to as the \"prisoner's dilemma\", based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. The story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime, and are locked up in separate cells. But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. Without a confession, the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.\n\nClearly the prisoners' best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime. And he tells them that if they don't confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they'll get life. Now, if you are prisoner confronted with this choice, your best bet is to confess. If your partner doesn't confess, you'll get off completely. And if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life. The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. Don't worry if you don't entirely follow it - you can to look it up on Google, where there are 283,000 entries on it.\n\nThe prisoners' dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively, but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.\n\nA cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both Russia and America would be better off with just a few arms, rather than a lot of arms. But as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other, an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms, results in arms levels that are too high. What economics tells us is that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it's hard to escape the perverse logic of it. It's no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. Somehow, the incentives have to change.\n\nIn the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. Every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments, solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. An example, is the famous rule that \"one divides, the other chooses\" as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in. If the rest of the party can enforce that, they'll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why does the argument not end?\nWhy does everyone want to have the last word?\nWhat is game theory?\nWhat is the solution for this type of problem?"}

{"prompt": "Tory leader unveils spending plan\n\nTory leader Michael Howard says his party can save \u00a335bn in government spending by tackling waste.\n\nThe money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. \"Let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did\", he told BBC 1's Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.\n\nThe bulk of the \u00a335bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The \u00a312bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the \"unfair taxes\". \"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,\" Mr Howard insisted. \"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. \"So part of the \u00a312bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. \"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.\"\n\nMr Howard is expected to say that around \u00a36bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by \u00a31.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of \u00a3153m at the Foreign Office and \u00a3336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James' proposals.\n\nMr Howard said: \"All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.\" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: \"None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is \u00a335bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: \"People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of \u00a335bn worth of savings. \"This can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities.\" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century.

{"prompt": "Blair blasts Tory spending plans\n\nTony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a \"ludicrous improbability\".\n\nThe prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure. Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut \u00a335bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow \u00a34bn in tax cuts. On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour. In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\n\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. And I say we have to fight.\" In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education. \"Everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,\" he said. Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\". \"The public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a Tory government,\" he concluded.\n\nGordon Brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some \u00a350bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny. Mr Brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be \"distracted or diverted\". According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: \"We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.\"\n\nMr Brown warned that the Tories were planning \"the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto\". Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans. \"He still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,\" Mr Letwin said. \"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the \u00a38bn shortfall in their plans?\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why is the Prime Minister so against Conservative proposals?\nWhat does the Tory party's leader, Michael Howard, believe are the Conservatives' proposals?\nWhy does the Prime Minister refer to both parties as \"hidebound\"?\nWhy did Gordon Brown address the conference behind closed doors?"}
{"prompt": "Lib Dems' 'bold' election policy\n\nCharles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an \"honest choice\" at the next general election.\n\nWith the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. It is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the Lib Dems and the other two. With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack. Now he is promising to levy a \"modest\" increase of the same amount on earnings over \u00a3100,000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. They are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. That last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less.\n\nLabour and the Tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.\n\nInevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through \u00a335bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered \u00a322bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases. In many ways the argument between the Lib Dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. But, unlike the old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see \"modest\" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. That is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.\n\nSimilarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not \"foment an artificial debate\" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas. Once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, Mr Kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party. Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be \"significant players\" in the poll. He repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. Mr Kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a Labour government with a small majority would amount to a \"massive vote of no confidence \" in Tony Blair's government.

{"prompt": "Prime minister's questions\n\nSo who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation?\n\nMichael Howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, he claims, is \"ramming\" through Parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. He didn't say so, but the Tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election And they believe Tony Blair is using the issue to suggest the Tories are soft on terrorism. Why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the Tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws, he demanded. The prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. Is not the opposition against to the proposed laws \"in principle\", in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless?\n\nWhat this is really about, believes Mr Blair, is the Tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass, maybe even defeat the government. And that is more important to them than national security. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. He preferred to state that, as with other issues like ID cards, the government's immediate instinct was authoritarian.\n\nAs is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Mr Kennedy than he had been with Mr Howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point. Apart from all that, it was electioneering as usual. The very first question to the prime minister from Derby North's Bob Laxton asked him, in effect, if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. Later Birmingham's Sion Simon even went so far as to suggest the Tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. The prime minister almost blushed. This was not the appropriate place to announce election day, he stammered. But can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 April for an election on 5 May is where the big money is in the Commons.

{"prompt": "Kilroy names election seat target\n\nEx-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk is to contest the Derbyshire seat of Erewash at the next general election.\n\nLabour's Elizabeth Blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June's European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\n\nOn Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\n\nUKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas' deputy leader.\n\nUKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. UKIP's leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said.

{"prompt": "Brown outlines third term vision\n\nGordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labour's next general election bid.\n\nHe said ensuring every child in Britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the NHS's creation. The chancellor has previously planned the party's election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn - a key ally of Tony Blair. The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.\n\nWriting in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. \"As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities.\" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was \"a warning shot\" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. \"It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,\" was Mr Marr's assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be \"central\". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was \"in part\" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy. And he pledged childcare would be a \"centrepiece\" of Labour's manifesto. He also predicted the next general election will be a \"tough, tough fight\" for New Labour. But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May.

{"prompt": "Teenagers to be allowed to be MPs\n\nTeenagers will be able to become MPs under plans unveiled by ministers.\n\nIn a written statement, Constitutional Affairs Minister Christopher Leslie said the current minimum age of 21 for an MP would be reduced to 18. The proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the Electoral Commission. \"The government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age,\" said Mr Leslie, who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24. Even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election, widely predicted for May.\n\nThe announcement from Mr Leslie - who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe Tory seat - prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16. The Votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to \"engage people\" by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective. \"Candidacy affects only politicians. The voting age affects millions of younger people,\" said spokesman Alex Folkes. \"We would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age.\"\n\nCurrently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18. That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. Irish republican Bernadette Devlin was one of just a handful of 21-year-olds elected to Parliament in the 20th century winning a seat in 1969. But the youngest is understood to have been Tory Edward Turnour, who won the 1904 Horsham by-election aged 21 and 144 days and served in Parliament for 47 continuous years.

It is currently arguing against an offer from Swiss Xstrata, which the firm raised to A$8.4bn last week after WMC said it was an undervaluation. Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal.\n\nTrade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be \"against the national interest\". Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstrata's attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia's Woodside Petroleum in 2001. The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds. WMC's interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals.

{"prompt": "UK rebate 'unjustified' - Chirac\n\nFrench president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's \u00a33bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\n\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\n\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\n\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\n\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\n\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\n\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What specific contribution to the EU budget is being talked about?\nWhat questions might the observer ask about this contribution?\nWhy are French president Jacques Chirac and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw talking about changing the UK's rebate?\nHow does UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman feel about France, Germany, France and Germany's desires to change or eliminate the UK's rebate?\nWhat message could Mr. Chirac send to those who want the rebate eliminated by eliminating it himself first in a negotiation?"}

Mr Brown has just returned from a tour of African nations. The \u00a31bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.\n\nThe chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday. Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra \u00a30.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi). Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation. That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. As well as pledging \u00a3960m over 15 years to the immunisation IFF, Britain urged other donors to contribute.\n\nIf Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra \u00a34bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued. Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. War on Want's John Hilary said: \"Compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. \"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What does the \u00a31bn pledge do for the 2000 Millennium Declaration?\nHow does this affect developing countries and how would the situation improve if Gavi increases its funding for immunisation by an extra \u00a34bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years?\nWhat is Gavi's relationship with the IFF and who is currently working on the plan to apply these principles to immunisation?\nIs there a contradiction in beliefs between what Brown says and what War on Want says about poverty?"}

{"prompt": "Abortion not a poll issue - Blair\n\nTony Blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue, arguing it is a matter for individual conscience.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman set out Mr Blair's view after the top Catholic in England and Wales backed Michael Howard's stance on abortions. The Tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are \"tantamount to abortion on demand\". The prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law.\n\nMr Blair's spokesman said: \"The Catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the Cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context.\" His words came as Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, backed Mr Howard's stance and distanced himself from Labour. In a statement, he said abortion was a \"very key issue\", saying: \"The policy supported by Mr Howard is one that we would commend, on the way to a full abandonment of abortion.\"\n\nCardinal O'Connor claimed Labour had \"developed\" the notion that it was the natural party of Catholics, but he said: \"We are not going to suggest people support one particular party.\" The Family Planning Association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. More than 180,000 women in England and Wales had terminations last year, of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks.\n\nIn the Cosmopolitan interview Mr Howard said: \"I believe abortion should be available to everyone, but the law should be changed. \"In the past I voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and I would be prepared to go down to 20.\" All three main parties say the issue is one for each MP's conscience, rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. Mr Howard stressed his views were his personal views. Shadow home secretary David Davis said he understood Mr Howard had been signalling that a Conservative government would allow a Commons vote on the issue. Mr Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also gave their views during interviews, conducted as part of the magazine's \"High Heeled Vote\" campaign.\n\nMr Blair, who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the Catholic faith despite regularly taking communion, said abortion was a \"difficult issue\". \"However much I dislike the idea of abortion, you should not criminalise a woman who, in very difficult circumstances, makes that choice. \"Obviously there is a time beyond which you can't have an abortion, and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue.\" Mr Kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean \"I don't know what I would do now\".

Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association, asked: \"What is the benefit to women, or to the potential child, of forcing a woman to have a baby?\" Anti-abortion group the Pro-Life Alliance \"congratulated\" Mr Howard on his new stance, but said it did not go far enough.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the main ideologies in this passage?\nWhat's Tony Blair's stance on abortion?\nWhat does Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor think about abortion?\nHow does the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff feel about abortion?\nDoes Anne Weyman believe abortion should be legalized for all women?"}
{"prompt": "Profile: Gordon Brown\n\nThe ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.\n\nHe reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: \"those who fail and those who get out in time.\") There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election. But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.\n\nGordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.\n\nHis first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram. But in 1983, he took Dunfermline East, a new constituency including Rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.\n\nEntering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair. Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.\n\nThe other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.\n\nThis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".\n\nIf that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.\n\nThe ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.\n\nA truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is Gordon Brown's nationality?\nWhat is his first and last name?\nWho are the two people he shares a history with - Tony Blair and Princess Marguerite of Romania?\nWhat is the city where he was born?\nWhen did he enter Westminster?\nWhat is his current job title in regards to the budget?\nHow much longer will Gordon Brown stay chancellor if Labour wins the general election?\nWhy has Mr Brown been Chancellor for so long in modern times and who was David Lloyd George before him as Chancellor of Modern Times?"}

But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele's record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. \"I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked,\" said Cragg. \"So I kept on the pace.

{"prompt": "Greek pair attend drugs hearing\n\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.\n\nThey were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee's offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. \"I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,\" said Papadoyiannakis. \"Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.\n\nThey withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". But Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,\" he said. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is this a typical way to pronounce the two athletes' names?\nWho are all of the people involved in this case?\nWhat is the procedure for appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport?\nWhy did they withdraw from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony?\nWhat possible charges do they face as a result of these allegations?"}

But the four-time world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career. The 30-year-old has set his sights on clinching the world 5,000m crown in Helsinki this summer. And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records.\n\nEl Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses. But the Moroccan will not commit himself to the St Galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going. \"The return to training was very difficult because I accepted a lot of invitations these past few months,\" said El Guerrouj. \"I am almost a month behind but I am on the right track.\"\n\n\n - Britain's Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships. \"I haven't quite decided what events I will compete in prior to London but the World Cross Country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility,\" said the two-time champion.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What has made Hicham El Guerrouj change his mind about racing at the World Cross Country Championships?\nHow does Hicham El Guerrouj feel about potentially meeting Kenenisa Bekele in March?\nWhat are Hicham El Guerrouj's future goals in running?\nEl Guerrouj and Radcliffe are retiring from competitive running.

{"prompt": "Collins appeals against drugs ban\n\nSprinter Michelle Collins has lodged an appeal against her eight-year doping ban with the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\nThe 33-year-old received the ban last month as a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. She is the first athlete to be banned without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. CAS has said that a ruling is normally given within four months of an appeal. Collins was suspended by the US Anti-Doping Agency based on patterns observed in her blood and urine tests as well as evidence in the Balco investigation. As well as being hit with the ban, Collins was stripped of her 2003 world and US indoor 200m titles.

{"prompt": "Feta cheese battle reaches court\n\nA row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name. The Commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.\n\nThe Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave \"protected designation of origin\" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.\n\nFrom 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products. The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. \"In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,\" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie. \"It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,\" Mr Kristiansen said. \"That is just one of the costs.\"\n\nThe case will also have a major impact on Britain's sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.\n\nJudy Bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. \"If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,\" she said. \"We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes - it's very clear from the label that it's Yorkshire feta.\" The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine. Greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption. The Court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the nature of the row?\nWhat are the legal consequences?\nHow did the original ruling affect producers in other parts of Europe?\nWho is responsible for this ruling, and what agency does it belong to?\nWhat are the economic impacts of this case for different producers?\nWhen is a verdict expected?"}
{"prompt": "Radcliffe tackles marathon tasks\n\nPaula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\n\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \n\nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\n\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \n\nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \n\nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \n\nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\n\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \n\n\n\nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the most likely outcome for Radcliffe in the race?\nWhat are her chances of winning or losing?\nHow will she know whether she has won or lost at the end of the race?\nWhat are possible consequences for Radcliffe if she wins or loses?\nWhere does Radcliffe want to finish and how much does it matter to her if she does not make this goal?\nWill Radcliffe's old running success factor into how people might react to her should she fail in New York City?\nIf Radcliffe fails, will this be a setback that makes or breaks her as an athlete?"}
{"prompt": "White admits to Balco drugs link\n\nBanned American sprinter Kelli White says she knowingly took steroids given to her by Bay Area Lab Co-Operative (Balco) president Victor Conte.\n\nConte faces a federal trial next year on charges of distributing steroids and tax evasion, and White said at first he tried to cover up what he was doing. \"He's the one who told me that it wasn't what he said it was,\" White said in the San Francisco Chronicle. But she added: \"It was my decision to go to him, not anybody else's.\" White said Conte at first told her the substance was flaxseed oil, only to change his story later. White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\n\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case. The 27-year-old believes doping is so common in sport she felt compelled to cheat herself if she was to have any chance of winning. \"I have no clue what it's going to take to change that,\" said White. \"I would say I made a mistake and I would never, ever go back. \"I would never recommend anyone to take that route.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who is Victor Conte?\nWhat are Balco, Bay Area Lab Co-Operative, and Tax Evasion?\nWhat substances did Kelli White knowingly take from Bay Area Lab Co-Operative?\nWhen did Kelli White admit to taking the substance?\nWhy would this matter if she was already found guilty of using it after being issued a 2 year ban for failing a drug test?\nWhat does this passage say about Kelli White's mindset regarding doping and her understanding that it is not uncommon in other sports like athletics?"}
{"prompt": "Record fails to lift lacklustre meet\n\nYelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham.\n\nAnd hey, there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record.\n\nApparently, Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\n\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\n\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How many world records did Yelena Isinbayeva break during the meet?\nWhat is standing in between Kelly Holmes and a European Indoor Championship medal?\nWhat are the standings of Mark Lewis-Francis, Jason Gardener, Agnes Samaria, Meseret Defar, Bernard Lagat, Kenenisa Bekele?\nWhy were conditions not optimal for distance runners?"}

There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I'd be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I'd fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\n\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:'OK, I've got a different set of circumstances now'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\n\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it's very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there's a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\n\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It's all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn't really help with the strength. \"There's a lot of work involved in my recovery. I'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work. \"I'm also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles. I'm fairly full on with everything I do. \"I'd hope to be training regularly by March. But training is just part of the process of getting back. \"At the moment, every time I go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. \"It's a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts.

{"prompt": "Man Utd stroll to Cup win\n\nWayne Rooney made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter-finals.\n\nRooney received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from Quinton Fortune and Cristiano Ronaldo silenced the jeers at Goodison Park. Fortune headed home after 23 minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes' free-kick. Marcus Bent missed Everton's best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.\n\nRooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And Rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent, played onside by Gabriel Heintze, hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when Ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert, but Martyn dived to save brilliantly. And Martyn came to Everton's rescue three minutes later when Rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. Scholes' free-kick took a deflection, and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. Everton's problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal.

{"prompt": "Van Nistelrooy set to return\n\nManchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may make his comeback after an Achilles tendon injury in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday.\n\nHe has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February. But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front.

{"prompt": "Rangers seal Old Firm win\n\nGoals from Gregory Vignal and Nacho Novo gave Rangers a scrappy victory at Celtic Park that moves them three points clear of the champions.\n\nRangers had rarely threatened until Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas let defender Vignal's 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. Opposite number Ronald Waterreus had been Rangers' hero, saving superbly from Craig Bellamy and John Hartson. Striker Novo secured victory, lobbing Douglas with eight minutes remaining. It ended Celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals. Celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season. They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield. It took Bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on Marvin Andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by Waterreus at the second attempt. He had an even better chance after Hartson dispossesed Sotiris Kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. But Waterreus did well to beat away Bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. Waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to Hartson just inside the box and the Dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian. But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. Dado Prso turned inside Neil Lennon only for the Celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. A great defensive header by Andrews prevented Hartson pouncing from five yards out. Hartson foxed Vignal at the edge of the Rangers box, but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by Waterreus. Rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and Vignal, collecting a knock back from Fernando Ricksen, broke the deadlock, Douglas somehow letting the Frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp. Novo pounced on a moments' hesitation in the Celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from Ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing Douglas. Ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin, but it could not prevent Rangers' celebrations at the final whistle.\n\n: Douglas, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Laursen, Petrov, Lennon, Sutton, Thompson, Bellamy, Hartson.\n\nSubs: Marshall, Henchoz, Juninho Paulista, Lambert, Maloney, Wallace, McGeady.\n\n: Waterreus, Hutton, Kyrgiakos, Andrews, Ball, Buffel, Ferguson, Ricksen, Vignal, Prso, Novo.\n\nSubs: McGregor, Namouchi, Burke, Alex Rae, Malcolm, Thompson, Lovenkrands.\n\n: M McCurry\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who scored for Rangers?\nWhat was the final score?\nWhat is the condition of Rangers' key player Barry Ferguson and why did he not play a game for Rangers?\nWho did Celtic have as their star striker Chris Sutton?\nWhy was Novo's goal so significant to the outcome of the game?"}
{"prompt": "Why few targets are better than many\n\nThe economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010.\n\nBut the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn't become a global economic laggard. They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States. That's why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on Wednesday, by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.\n\nLisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said. \"The status quo is not an option.\"\n\nAt risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built, it said. The report comes at a time when Europe's competitive position is waning. The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far. That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.\n\nAs Mr Kok's report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"\n\nThe circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group. \"What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. You find trade unions fighting change. But also the employers' associations. \"Even though they tell you they're in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"\n\nBut part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago. Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report. Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\n\n\"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said. \"Everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they're taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"Rhetoric and delivery don't necessarily go hand in hand,\" Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"We don't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"\n\nOn one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"It's very ambitious,\" said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. \"This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. It's going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. For example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. But it doesn't say how companies should be convinced to do this. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok's recommendations and press them on EU governments. Mr Barroso has said that the EU's competitiveness will be his top priority. He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europe's success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why were the original targets set for the Lisbon summit too broad and all encompassing?\nWhat are Wim Kok's recommendations for dealing with the severity of these Lisbon goals and challenges?\nHas there been an agreement from EU member states to these targets?\nWhat are the Lisbon goals?\nWhat is the Wim Kok report?\nWhy is this important for Europe's competitiveness?\nWho should be considered the European Commission president by the economic analysts and economists?\nHow will the president of the European Commission (Barroso) judge his five year term in office according to this essay?"}

RHB, Malaysia's third-biggest lender, is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new Islamic banking unit, the firm told Reuters. The moves put Malaysia ahead of a 2007 deadline to open up the sector. The country's deal to join the World Trade Organisation set that year as a deadline for liberalisation of Islamic banking.

{"prompt": "Hodgson relishes European clashes\n\nFormer Blackburn boss Roy Hodgson says the Premiership should follow the rest of Europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the English elite's bid for Champions League glory.\n\nHodgson - now in charge at Viking Stavanger - was at Liverpool's clash with Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield on Tuesday as a member of Uefa's technical committee. Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe, although not in England - where the Champions League contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. But Hodgson told BBC Sport that while he believes the Premiership should embrace the idea, he does not expect it to cost the English representatives in the last 16 of the Champions League. \"I just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge. \"I am a fervent supporter of the break. It gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the Champions League. \"The other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. \"The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February.\" Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: \"As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.\n\n\"And certainly if I was still a manager in England I would be supporting any calls for its introduction. \"In pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards Christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded. \"The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. \"The mental side is by far the most important thing.\" Hodgson added: \"The length of breaks can vary. In Italy the break was very short. You just took Christmas and New Year. \"It was so short you didn't do anything. You gave the players a week or 10 days off, then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game. \"If it is longer, it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.\" And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership. He said: \"If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break. \"If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is Hodgson correct in his idea that the \"the longer the break, the more players gain an advantage?\"\nHow are clubs in England and other countries affected by a winter break?\nWhat is the difference between \"physical fitness\" and \"mental strength\"?\nShould there be a break in English soccer as well?"}

{"prompt": "Prutton poised for lengthy FA ban\n\nSouthampton's David Prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the Football Association.\n\nThe 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal. The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee Alan Wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee Paul Norman. And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.\n\nPaolo di Canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee Paul Alcock over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998. Prutton will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss Harry Redknapp, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player.

He added: \"Jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But I trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it.\n\n\"The plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on Monday we will clarify the situation.\" Arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before Tottenham's Premiership fixture with Charlton. \"When it comes down to personal problems, I don't think we should talk about timing,\" he said.

{"prompt": "House prices show slight increase\n\nPrices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February, says the Nationwide building society.\n\nThe figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2%, the lowest rate since June 2001. The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.\n\nNationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. \"We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared,\" said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.\n\nThe price of an average UK property now stands at \u00a3152,879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.\n\n\"I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline.\" House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.\n\nFurther evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004.

Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric said he was \"disappointed\" by the news and claimed Redknapp had been in talks with Southampton for \"some time\".\n\n\"It would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time,\" Mandaric said on Portsmouth's official website. \"I am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of Southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed.\" According to Mandaric, Redknapp vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. \"I said to Harry 'I hope you don't go to Southampton', and he told me 'absolutely not',\" he said. \"I'm wouldn't say I'm bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it's Harry's life and it's his decision.\" Redknapp became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with Mandaric's decision to bring in Velimir Zajec as executive director.\n\nSouthampton chairman Rupert Lowe was desperate to give former academy director Wigley, who replaced Paul Sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary's. But results under Wigley have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table.

At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. \"Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession,\" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.\n\nWithin the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods.

I recognise Leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the Premiership, and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can.\" Bates bought his stake under the guise of a Geneva-based company known as The Forward Sports Fund. He revealed that part of his plan is to buy back Leeds' Elland Road stadium and Thorp Arch training ground in due course.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors,\" Bates added. \"But there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. For the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again.\" Outgoing Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner said: \"This deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and I believe Mr Bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club. \"We are content that under Mr Bates, Leeds United will continue to consolidate and move forward. \"When we took over Leeds United in March 2004, the club had a debt of \u00a3103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under \u00a325m. \"We worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at Leeds United. \"Eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with Mr Bates to secure its ongoing success.\" Krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. He will stay on in an unpaid capacity while Peter Lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and Peter McCormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. The other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of \u00a34.5m in the company for the next four years. On Leeds' new-look board it is understood that Lorimer will be joined by former Chelsea finance director Yvonne Todd and Bates' lawyer Mark Taylor.\n\nKrasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover.

{"prompt": "Reds sink 10-man Magpies\n\nTitus Bramble's own goal put Liverpool on the comeback trail as injury-hit Newcastle were well beaten at Anfield.\n\nPatrick Kluivert's close-range finish put Newcastle ahead after 31 minutes, but they were pegged back as Bramble headed in Steven Gerrard's corner. Neil Mellor gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from Milan Baros' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had Lee Bowyer sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back Luis Garcia after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after Craig Bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And Garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from Baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. Olivier Bernard was only inches away from giving Newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. But Souness's side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances.\n\nKluivert looked suspiciously offside when Kieron Dyer set Bowyer free, but the Dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. The lead lasted three minutes, with Liverpool back on terms as Bramble headed Gerrard's corner into his own net under pressure from Sami Hyypia. And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when Baros slid a perfect pass into Mellor's path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into Given's bottom corner. Garcia's finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at Given after good work by Xabi Alonso. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by Harry Kewell set Baros free and he rounded Given to score. Jermaine Jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross.

Italy have lost both their opening games at home to Ireland and Wales, but travel to Edinburgh with high hopes.\n\nTheir coach John Kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to Wales however or risk suffering a third successive defeat. \"If the defeat against Wales has taught us anything, it's that at this level we can't make any mistakes,\" Kirwan said. \"In the Six Nations, every error you make will come at a high price. \"We have to be aggressive for 80 minutes, keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch.\n\n\"It will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments - in the key situations of the game.\" Kirwan has recalled the experienced Cristian Stoica at centre and drafted in David dal Maso at open-side after star flanker Mauro Bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Scotland have also made two changes, Simon Webster replacing Simon Danielli on the wing and Simon Taylor returning for his first Test in a year, for injured flanker Jason White. Taylor's recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to Scottish hopes. \"He is one of the world-class players in the tournament and you want them in your team,\" acknowledged Williams.\n\nDespite a record of only two victories from 14 Tests, Williams insists he is revelling in the pressure. \"I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach,\" he said, optimistic despite opening defeats to France and Ireland. \"We were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too,\" he added.\n\n: C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\n\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\n\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, C Stoica, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni; S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt); A Persico, D Dal Maso, S Parisse.\n\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, S Orlando, P Griffen, R Pedrazzi, KP Robertson.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the coach's moral responsibility?\nWhat ethical considerations might an observer question?\nWhat professional and physical demands do rugby players face?\nWhat physical strength and endurance are needed for this position?\n"}
{"prompt": "Corry backs skipper Robinson\n\nEngland forward Martin Corry says Jason Robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.\n\nAfter losses to Wales and France, critics have started to wonder whether Robinson can captain from full-back. But Corry has backed Robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, ahead of this weekend's trip to Ireland. \"Jason is doing a tremendous job. Every week my respect for him goes up,\" Corry told BBC Radio Five Live. \"He is an inspirational captain. When he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense. \"The players have a lot of respect for him. It's an honour to be in the England side and an honour to play under him.\"\n\nEngland are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their Six Nations campaign. But Corry insists England are in the right frame of mind for the contest. \"There is apprehension going into every game,\" he added. \"But you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset. \"When the whistle goes on Sunday, what has happened in the past does not count for anything.\n\n\"We have not performed but if we put in a performance on Sunday then we can start turning results around. \"There are a lot of changes taking place with England and we are at the start of something. We have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.\"\n\nA trip to Lansdowne Road is daunting at any time, especially against an Ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. They are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first Grand Slam since 1948. But Corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the Irish in their own backyard. \"They are full of confidence and are playing a great team game,\" he said. \"The forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide. \"If you look at the team on paper, they have stars from one to 15.

A decision will be taken on Saturday as to whether the 26-year-old will be declared fit. If he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by Andy Hazell. Chris Jones will then start the game on the bench. \"The chances of him playing are very slim,\" said coach Andy Robinson. \"The infection is deeper than was thought.\"\n\nMoody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger. He suffered the cut playing against France at Twickenham and it became infected during a 10-minute outing as a replacement for Leicester against Newcastle last Saturday. \"The mud got into it,\" Robinson added. \"He has had a big course of antibiotics but they haven't done the job we hoped they would.\" Robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with Bath prop Matt Stevens coming in for the injured Phil Vickery.\n\nThe 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench. \"It can be frustrating but I've had a lot more game time this season and I'm ready for it,\" Stevens said. \"I've been on tour with these boys and I've been in the England set-up for two years so I know the calls and the way they play.\" Stevens will be winning his third cap on Sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to New Zealand last year.\n\nRobinson has confirmed that fly-half Charlie Hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against France. \"Charlie's state of mind is very good,\" said Robinson. \"Obviously, we are all disappointed we lost the French game and the circumstances in which we did. \"But he responded well last week in his goalkicking for Sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week.\"\n\nRobinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against Irish duo Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game. \"In each game we've missed a number of line-outs,\" he added. \"It cost us the game against Wales but it has improved. \"It was better against France and will have to go up another notch against Ireland.

{"prompt": "Italy aim to rattle England\n\nItaly coach John Kirwan believes his side can upset England as the Six Nations wooden spoon battle hots up.\n\nThe two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of England's current slump. \"We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them. \"England have not been having the best of championships. That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,\" he said. But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London. Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. Kirwan said: \"The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. \"But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England.\" England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson's kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland's line.\n\nBut centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats. \"We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,\" he said. \"We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. \"We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game. We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win.\" England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson.

As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an \"injury audit\" to find out how players are coping. The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players' Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby. As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored. \"I think there's an injury audit coming out in March that's got some great information in there that I think everybody in the English game has got to look at,\" he said. \"If we don't the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who is England's coach?\nWhat does Andy Robinson say about the state of rugby in England?\nIn what year did rugby become professional in England?\nWhat stakeholder organizations are participating in the injury audit and why does Robinson want them to read it?"}

A hamstring injury denied Luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start, but the Dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to Murrayfield on 13 March. Hooker Robin McBryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in Paris, but centre Sonny Parker and flanker Colin Charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection.

{"prompt": "Italy 8-38 Wales\n\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\n\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\n\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\n\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\n\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\n\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\n\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\n\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\n\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\n\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\n\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\n\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are Wales's positions of the game?\nWhat is Wales's goal in this match and how does it wish to achieve this goal?\nHow does Italy feel about its position in the game, what goals does it have?\nWhat changes should England be making after watching this game (if any)?\nWhat should Ireland do to get ahead of Wales (if they needed to)?"}

Rusedski had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after Henman double-faulted, but missed his chance and Henman rallied to clinch the set. The British number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over Rusedski.

A furious Rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire.\n\nHenman, seeded three, then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve-and-volley winners to take a clear 5-3 lead. Rusedski won his service game but Henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at Dubai for the first time in three years. It was the first match between the pair for three years - Henman last lost to Rusedski six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes.

Williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games. She quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as Davenport's game collapsed, allowing Williams to take the title. Williams later explained her injury problem, saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set. \"Lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually I was able to come back, thank goodness,\" she said. Davenport paid tribute to Williams, saying: \"She's had a tough couple of years and she's come back like a champion.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action. Davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second. \"I kept thinking to myself 'I'm not losing this game,\" said Williams afterwards. \"'I don't care if my arm falls off, I'm not losing this game'.

World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.\n\nAnalysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. The French statistics agency, INSEE, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. That is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What does the author mean by \"Weak data buffets French economy\"?\nHow has unemployment stayed at 9.9% last month?\nWhy do some economists say that there is an urgent need for structural reforms to tackle France's high unemployment?\nWhat would happen if the non-wage payroll costs and restrictions on working hours are not repealed?"}
{"prompt": "China net cafe culture crackdown\n\nChinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.\n\nAccording to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a \"safer environment for young people in China\". Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. The 12,575 cafes were shut in the three months from October to December. China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.\n\nNet cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. All the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. During the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What restrictions are in place for children to use net cafes?\nWhat was the government's concern and reasoning behind the crackdown?\nWhat steps have they taken before this crackdown?\nHow does it effect people who can't afford a personal computer?\nAre there any companies that have been affected by this and is this an appropriate way to limit moral issues in China?"}
{"prompt": "Sun offers processing by the hour\n\nSun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.\n\nSun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.\n\nThe system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. \"Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?\" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.\n\nSome of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.\n\nAlthough it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (\u00a36.30) because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is a grid?\nWhat is Sun Grid, specifically?\nHow does it differ from other grid computing systems?\nWhat are the implications of this system for future energy needs?"}

{"prompt": "Piero gives rugby perspective\n\nBBC Sport unveils its new analysis tool Piero at the Wales v England rugby union match on Saturday. But what does it do and how does it work?\n\nPicture the scene - Wales are camped on the England line in the dying seconds of the Six Nations' opening match. A ball is flung out to winger Shane Williams who crosses to score the winning try for Wales. But the England players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. In the past, sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes.\n\nPiero, named after the Italian painter and pioneer of perspective Piero della Francesco, creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom, giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. The technology has been created by BBC Research and Development for BBC Broadcast and BBC Outside Broadcasts. BBC Sport is the first client to start using the system. \"In order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life,\" said Andrew Thompson, the BBC's head of development, new media and sports news. \"We want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis, more detail, more definitive answers about key passages of play.\" Piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a PC which can then render the information into 3D graphics.\n\nThe more cameras using Piero, the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models. \"It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play, tracking individual players across the field, looking at tactics,\" said Andy Townsend, from BBC Broadcast.\n\nAn operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents, as well as more in-depth analysis. The \"virtual camera\" can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch, giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. Piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks, to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. Mr Townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. BBC Broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is Piero?\nWhat is the technology for?\nIs this a system of beliefs or a system of logic and reason?\nDoes the viewer have control over which statistic they would like to see?\nHow does BBC plan on generating revenue from Piero?\nWhich sports production companies are already showing interest in Piero?"}
{"prompt": "Blind student 'hears in colour'\n\nA blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.\n\nVictor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study \"space weather\" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.\n\n\"The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,\" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. \"For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.\" He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. \"If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well.\"\n\nMr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a \"colour memory\" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. \"As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears.\" The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable.

While virus traffic has slowed down, denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. Virus mail accounts for just over 15% of all e-mail traffic analysis by the firm has found.\n\nIt is no longer just multi-nationals that are in danger of so-called denial of service attacks, in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. Email Systems refers to a small UK-based engineering firm, which received a staggering 12 million e-mails in January. The type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months, according to Email Systems analysis. Half of spam received since Christmas has been health-related with gambling and porn also on the increase. Scam mails, offering ways to make a quick buck, have declined by 40%. \"January is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities,\" said Neil Hammerton, managing director of Email Systems. \"Spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this, focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers, presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar,\" he said.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is email traffic going up or down?\nWhat percentage of spam is health-related?\nWhy are scam emails declining in January?\nWhen does Email Systems consider to be the \"bleakest month\"?"}
{"prompt": "Concern over RFID tags\n\nConsumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says.\n\nMore than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.\n\nMore than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. \"Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. \"With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point.\" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing.

{"prompt": "Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC\n\nNicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (\u00a353).\n\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\n\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why was there reluctance from teachers to embrace Mr. Negroponte's idea?\nWhat other ideas has he considered as a way of aiding the distribution of computers in developing countries?\nWho is considering ordering a large number of these devices and what will they be used for?\nIs this an altruistic or profit-seeking venture?"}
{"prompt": "Tough rules for ringtone sellers\n\nFirms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.\n\nThe rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.\n\nIn the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone.\n\n\"If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,\" he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. \"What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,\" said Mr Flynn. \"People did not know they were being offered a subscription service.\" \"We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,\" he added.\n\nThe swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. \"Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,\" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox.\n\n\"It's all about transparency,\" he said. \"Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.\" \"The consumer has a right to be protected,\" he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. \"The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,\" he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. \"We have quite draconian contracts with firms,\" he said. \"We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off.\" Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal \"stop\" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. \"The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,\" said Mr Flynn.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How will this code of conduct improve service provision?\nWhat caused the recent spike in content subscriptions from mobile phone users?\nAre consumers who have subscribed to these services vulnerable or at risk?\nWhat is the extent of consumer harm?\nHow did the drafting of the new rules help to stop potential abuse by companies that sell content for mobile phones?"}
{"prompt": "Games enter the classroom\n\nVideo games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.\n\nWith violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. \"Games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving,\" said Martin Owen, at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.\n\nFuturelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. \"Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,\" said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.\n\nIt is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. \"We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational,\" said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen.\n\nThe game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. \"Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,\" said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. \"Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,\" he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.\n\nUse of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. \"It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,\" she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen. \"Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people,\" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is it ethical to teach children the mechanics of a car if they can only reach it by playing the game?\nWhy are publishers unwilling to make games for the educational market?\nWould more students be willing to take classes where they could play video games?\nAre there any other benefits of using video games in classrooms?\nWhat types of games should be made for classrooms?\nHow do chatrooms and games interact with each other?\nShould teachers be worried about children playing video games that they do not know are educational?"}
{"prompt": "China 'to overtake US net use'\n\nThe Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years, says a report.\n\nChina's net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country's 1.3 billion people. Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008. The report says that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.\n\nAlready net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations, said William Makower, chief executive of Panlogic. In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare. This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China. Only 36% of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports. \"Net usage tends to happen in the evening,\" said Mr Makower, \"they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.\" \"Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here,\" he said.\n\nNet use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends, said Mr Makower. Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life. For instance, said Mr Makower, credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. \"The most popular way to pay is Cash-On-Delivery,\" he said, \"and that's quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.\" The arrival of foreign banks in China, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said Mr Makower. But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living. \"A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar,\" he said. \"Generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it.\" \"Its real value is as an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world,\" he said. Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else. Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. \"It's a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it,\" said Mr Makower.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How much does the population of China use the internet?

{"prompt": "Nintendo handheld given Euro date\n\nNintendo's new handheld console, the DS, will launch in Europe on 11 March, the company has announced.\n\nThe portable games machine, which features touch-screen control, will retail for \u00a399 in the UK (149 euros). Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from \u00a319 to \u00a329. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.\n\nThe 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.\n\nMore than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a \"download play\" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.\n\nThe launch price of \u00a399 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. \"It's a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,\" he says. \"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example.\"\n\nMr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. \"The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,\" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest.\n\nIn the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was \"pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch\". \"Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,\" Mr Iwata added.

{"prompt": "Net regulation 'still possible'\n\nThe blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.\n\nContent on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.\n\n\"The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,\" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.\n\nSome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. \"How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them \"mere conduits\" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.\n\nOne of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of \"impossible to regulate\" and \"just apply offline laws online\". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. \"If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net,\" said Mr Burke.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is net regulation?\nWhat criteria do some observers believe should govern it?\nWho is Ofcom and what does it do?\nIs content on TV and the internet moving closer this year?

{"prompt": "Home phones face unclear future\n\nThe fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species.\n\nResearch by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile.\n\nThe Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. In all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone, the research found.\n\nThe move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house.\n\nMany of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the \"cosiness\" of making a call there. Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality. The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6,000 people in the UK, US, Germany and South Korea for the survey.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the difference between a home phone and a mobile phone?\nWhat does it mean to be \"mobile\"?\nHow are home phones used differently in different cultures?\nWhat are the benefits of using a fixed line phone more than a mobile phone?\nWill the use of home phones cease to exist?"}

Conferring the award, PC Pro's staff picked out Sony's PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a \"stunning piece of engineering\". The electronics giant beat off strong competition from Toshiba and chip makers AMD and Intel to take the gong.\n\nPaul Trotter, news and features editor of PC Pro, said several Sony products helped it to take the innovation award.\n\nHe said Sony's Clie PEG UX50 media player with its swivel screen and qwerty keyboard \"broke the design rules yet again\". Other Sony products that helped included the Vaio W1 desktop computer and the RA-104 media server. Mr Trotter said Sony's combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs. The company has also become one of the first to use organic LEDs in its products. \"While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats,\" said Mr Trotter.\n\nOther awards decided by PC Pro's staff and contributors included one for Canon's EOS 300D digital camera in the Most Wanted Hardware category.\n\nMicrosoft's Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software.

{"prompt": "Putting a face to 'Big Brother'\n\nLiterally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.\n\nImagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. Basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. Together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. Some of these ideas have been showcased at the London's Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition.\n\nOne such avatar is Jeremiah. It is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer.\n\nHis creator, Richard Bowden, lecturer at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey, refers to Jeremiah as \"him\", rather than it. \"Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. He is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus,\" he told the BBC News website. \"When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. If you ignore him, he gets angry. If you leave, he gets sad. And you can also even surprise him.\" Jeremiah is not actually intelligent. It works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. It is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish. \"I am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that,\" explained Dr Bowden.\n\nThe research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.\n\nExperts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. \"If you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea,\" said Dr Bowden. \"Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on.\" You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future. But it might all depend on the face that is watching you. \"When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,\" said Dr Bowden. \"But when Jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the purpose of this passage?\nWhat does Jeremiah do?\nWhat are the benefits of avatars?\nHow do avatars have an impact on society?\nWhat is the next step in Dr. Bowden's research with avatars?"}
{"prompt": "Freeze on anti-spam campaign\n\nA campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.\n\nEarlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words \"Stay tuned\". No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.\n\nLycos Europe's \"Make love not spam\" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. But the plan has proved controversial.\n\nMonitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.\n\nThe downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, \"Stay tuned\". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. \"Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,\" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. \"Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the Lycos campaign?\nWhat are the different positions of other organisations about the campaign?\nWhat are the implications of all this for companies that rely on spam to advertise their services?\nIs Lycos's campaign violent and illegal?\nWhat does the host of the screensaver site now show?\nWhen did Lycos put the campaign on hold?\nWhy did Lycos put the campaign on hold?\nWhat do people say about this campaign?"}
{"prompt": "'Blog' picked as word of the year\n\nThe term \"blog\" has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a US dictionary publisher.\n\nMerriam-Webster said \"blog\" headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. During 2004 blogs, or web logs, have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. Other words on the Merriam-Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a blog as: \"a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks\". Its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words, that everyone likes to look up, or those that always cause problems, such as \"affect\" and \"effect\".\n\nMerriam-Webster said \"blog\" was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. The word will now appear in the 2005 version of Merriam-Webster's printed dictionary. However, the word is already included in some printed versions of the Oxford English Dictionary. A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners, reflecting its mainstream use. \"I think it was the word of last year rather than this year,\" he said. \"Now we're getting words that derive from it such as 'blogosphere' and so on,\" he said. \"But,\" he added, \"it's a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it's got established very quickly.\"\n\nBlogs come in many different forms. Many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects, some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. Other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the US, such as \"hurricane\" or were to do with the US election. Words such as \"incumbent\", \"electoral\" and \"partisan\" reflected the scale of interest in the vote. Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. Speculation that President Bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bush's war record. The immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day. One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence, the blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. According to US research firm Pew Internet & American Life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. In many repressive regimes and developing nations, blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is it ethical to use terms that are not found in the Merriam-Webster's dictionary?\nIs the internet becoming more influential than mainstream media?\nWhat is considered moral or ethical for blogs?\nWould a blog stand up to political/social agendas?"}

The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years. Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update. December's share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month. Cairn's shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on Thursday.\n\nBefore Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct. \"This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong,\" Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said. Chief executive Bill Gammell added: \"The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it.\" Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities. The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries.

{"prompt": "File-swappers ready new network\n\nLegal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.\n\nOne site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January. But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are \"quality copies\".\n\nIn late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network. The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised. That file-sharing system relies on links called \"trackers\" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.\n\nNow the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. There will be no centrally maintained list. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. An early public version of the software should be available before February. Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nUsers of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream.\n\nDr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. \"Exeem cannot prevent pollution,\" he said. \"The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,\" he said. Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes. By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. \"The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa,\" he said. \"There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,\" he said. Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse. He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. \"It's hard to compete with free,\" he said. No-one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the drawbacks of Exeem?\nWhat is Swarm Systems?\nWhat problems might Exeem have that BitTorrent did not have?\nWhich organizations may be working to sabotage the success of Exeem?"}

Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\n\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home.

But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. And yes, that includes Halo 2.

Along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers' Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003. Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November. Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.\n\nAuthenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.\n\n\"If you're issued a seafarer's ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed,\" Authenti-corp's CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBC's Go Digital programme. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention.

The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. \"By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,\" said Ms Musselman. \"It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards?\nIs the technology new or older?\nWhat is it made out of?\nWho will be the first to use it?\nWhat will happen once someone is issued one of these cards?\nWhere does the UN Convention say these cards should be issued in relation to their seafarers' needs?\nWhat can this technology reduce?\nWho has been involved in creating and implementing this technology for ID cards?"}

Rock outfit Rooster are playing what has been billed as the first ever concert broadcast by phone on Tuesday evening from a London venue. The 45-minute gig is due to be \"phone cast\" by the 3G mobile phone operator, 3. 3G technology lets people take, watch and send video clips on their phones, as well as swap data much faster than with 2G networks like GSM. People with 3G phones in the UK can already download football and music clips on their handsets.\n\nSome 1,000 fans of the London-based band will have to pay five pounds for a ticket and need a 3G handset.\n\n\"Once you have paid, you can come and go as much as you like, because we expect the customers to be mobile,\" said 3 spokesperson Belinda Henderson. \"It's like going to a concert hall, except that you are virtually there.\" The company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones. \"We are looking on how long people will stay on average on the streams. Some people may stay the whole time, some may dip in and out,\" said Ms Henderson. \"We actually expect people to dip in and out because they are mobile and they will be doing other things.\" 3 is looking to music as a way of persuading more people to take up the latest video phones.

{"prompt": "Screensaver tackles spam websites\n\nNet users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites\n\nInternet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.\n\n\"We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,\" said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. \"In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users,\" he said, \"but now we are going to go one step further.\"\n\n\"We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers.\" By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. \"Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,\" he said, \"about one MP3 file.\" But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann. \"That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing,\" he said.\n\nThe sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.\n\nTypically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann. Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver. While working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden. Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. \"There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more,\" he said \"Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who is publishing this article?\nIs the screensaver being made available to all users, or only those who are Lycos subscribers?\nDo the screensaver requests themselves slow down other internet browsing/content downloading time?\nDoes this screensaver affect other people's computer usage besides spam websites (e.g. slowing their download rates)?"}
{"prompt": "Mobile gaming takes off in India\n\nGaming on the move is one of the fastest-growing activities among the tech-savvy in India, says a report.\n\nThe Indian mobile gaming market is expected to generate about $26m (\u00a313.8m) by the end of 2004, according to market analysts In-Stat/MDR. In October, mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million, overtaking the number of landlines, said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. India has a large population of under-25s, and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets.\n\nIndia's mobile gaming market will bring in about $336m (\u00a3178m) by 2009, according to the report. Mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. Analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009, generating billions for mobile companies.\n\nServices other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in India have, as a result of the huge rise in subscribers, grown significantly and rapidly. \"The growth of this market sector has attracted publishers, developers, animators, musicians, and content providers, and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models,\" said Clint Wheelock, director of In-Stat/MDR's wireless research group.\n\n\"Mobile gaming is not just about fun; it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers, and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players.\" Currently, India has six big games developers and four mobile operators that offer games to their subscribers, said the report. According to In-Stat/MDR, it is tipped to make up one of the most important markets in the next wave of mobile multimedia growth.\n\nIn January 2003, there were only 10 million mobile subscribers in India. Many choose mobiles in rural areas in order to bypass poorer telecoms infrastructure. Despite this, the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries. Less than 20% of India's total population own a mobile in India, compared to well over 50% in most European countries. The trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies, which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive state-run fixed-line operators.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is mobile gaming?\nWhat market does India have a large population of under-25s, and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets?\nHow many people play games on phones by 2009 and how much will they generate for the mobile companies?\nWhat service other than voice calls are offered by mobile operators in India?\nWhat factors is In-Stat/MDR looking at to make their prediction about the size of India's market for mobile gaming in 2009?"}
{"prompt": "MCI shareholder sues to stop bid\n\nA shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (\u00a33.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders \"of maximum value\".\n\nAccording the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an \"\"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate\" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.\n\nIn 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What company is the shareholder filing the lawsuit against?\nDid these shareholders lose money when Worldcom filed for bankruptcy?\nWhy is MCI seen as a valuable asset?\nWhich company recently bought MCI, and how much did they offer to pay?\nWhat other companies have bought one of their competitors in recent months for many billions of dollars?"}
{"prompt": "Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice'\n\nFaster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests.\n\nInstead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\n\nFor the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\n\nOne good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\n\nAnother factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\n\nOnce this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why did the 14,000 participants in the study use their mobile phones?\nWhat specific reasons led to the popularity of camera phones in Japan and Europe?\nWhat are some of the different \"tribes\" of phone users according to Ericsson?\nWhy is it important for 25% of all consumers to have handsets with new innovations on them before use of these innovations becomes widespread?"}
{"prompt": "Cyber criminals step up the pace\n\nSo-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.\n\nThe number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.\n\nIn its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.\n\nOlder attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. \"E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,\" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. \"In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,\" he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. \"Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,\" he said. Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam.

{"prompt": "Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion\n\nThe growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine.\n\nIt issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2. The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine. Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft's subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live. Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare.\n\nBut the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin.\n\nIn a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. \"The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call,\" he said. \"ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games,\" he added.\n\nOne of the main factors that spoils online gaming is \"lag\" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest \"lag\". Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group. \"In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,\" she said. In countries such as Korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the growing popularity of online gaming (Halo 2) causing service providers to worry about?\nAre network operators finding it difficult to cope with increased demands for bandwidth?\nWhat do analysts say the large number of gamers on Xbox Live indicates about the state of broadband penetration in markets that have high levels of fast net connections to homes, such as Korea?\nWhat are some challenges for game networks coming from service providers and what are some solutions?"}
{"prompt": "Set your television to wow\n\nTelevision started off as a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. Now the TV set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in Europe will have to be patient.\n\nAfter years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan. If you believe the hype, then HDTV will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. \"HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes,\" says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. All television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down. British TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. The result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard TV. But to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them. Most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.\n\nBut TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.\n\nMany high-end European TV programmes, such as the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. The prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. According to consultants Strategy Analytics, only 12% of homes in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. Big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public's attention. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be broadcast in high-definition.\n\nIn the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006. There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080. Other European broadcasters, especially in France and Germany, also aiming to launch similar services.\n\nIn Britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for HDTV, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. The communications watchdog Ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the UK switches off its analogue TV signal. For now, broadcasters like the BBC are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight. \"The BBC will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming,\" says Andy Quested, from the BBC's high-definition support group. \"We have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put us on the leading edge.\" One of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. The BBC has already dipped its toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for PCs. It is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV. This is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What makes the picture sharper in HDTV than in standard TV?\nWhat are the advantages of HDTV over standard TV?\nWhat causes HDTV to be harder to access in Europe than in America?\nAre BBC plans for high-definition television a sign that Europe will catch up with America and Japan?"}
{"prompt": "PC photo printers challenge pros\n\nHome printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers, tests shows.\n\nA survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab. The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months, warned the magazine.\n\nThe group test of 100 home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops, Boots and Snappy Snaps. The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than \u00a32 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store. \"If you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer,\" said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro.\n\nMr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers. Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in, said Mr Ross, but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. According to PC Pro, producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper costs \u00a31.87. At Jessops the same image would cost \u00a32.50 and at Snappy Snaps \u00a39.99. A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost \u00a34.99. \"Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home,\" he said. Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. \"Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one,\" she said. \"Many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don't want the hassle,\" she added. The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading. It recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Can the quality of the image be preserved if it is printed in a different format than the original?\nWhat are the requirements for maximum resistance to smudging or water damage?\nWhat is the cost of a digital photo print 8x10in using an Epson R800 printer with top quality paper?\nIs home printing cheaper than sending images to high street stores like Snappy Snaps, Boots, and Jessops?\n"}

The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan.\n\nThe Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.\n\nThe launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan.

{"prompt": "Video phone help for deaf people\n\nDeaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\n\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current \u00a37.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.\n\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\n\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\n\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year.

{"prompt": "EU software patent law delayed\n\nControversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland.\n\nPoland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software.\n\nPolish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US. So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. \"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,\" Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. \"Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them,\" she added.

It said two versions of the operating system, codenamed Tiger, were put onto the net in October and December. It is the second time in two weeks Apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. Tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005. Last week, it filed a lawsuit against \"unnamed individuals\" who leaked details about new products onto the web.\n\nThe latest action was against members of the Apple Developer Connection, a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them. \"Members of Apple Developer Connection receive advance copies of Apple software under strict confidentiality agreements, which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property,\" Apple said in a statement.\n\nIt added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software. It is thought the men used sites which employ BitTorrent technology. With BitTorrent technology, sites do not host actual files being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file. Last week, the Motion Picture Association of America launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the BitTorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy. Apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information. In December 2002, it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings, images and engineering details of its PowerMac G4 computer online.

{"prompt": "Yahoo moves into desktop search\n\nInternet giant Yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their PCs.\n\nThe firm is following in the footsteps of Microsoft, Google and Ask Jeeves, which have offered similar services. Search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. With hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos.\n\nThe desktop search technology has been licensed from a US-based firm X1 Technologies. It is designed to work alongside Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs. Searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. According to research from message analysts the Radicati Group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. Yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. Users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. \"We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,\" said Julian Smith, an analyst with research firm Jupiter. \"It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well,\" he said. Search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web. The new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups, concerned about the implications to privacy. And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. Alexander Linden, vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm Gartner,downloaded the Google product but has since removed it. \"It was just not very interesting,\" he said. He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals. \"Desktop search is just one of many features people would like but I'm suspicious of its usefulness,\" he said.

{"prompt": "EA to take on film and TV giants\n\nVideo game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.\n\nThe US firm says it wants to compete with companies such as Disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Its revenues were $3bn (\u00a31.65bn) in 2004, which EA hoped to double by 2009. EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the UK last year were published by EA.\n\nGerhard Florin, EA's managing director for European publishing, said: \"Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science.\" He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (\u00a316bn) - but it remained a goal for the company. \"We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional.\" Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion.\n\n\"It's the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn't really sell the emotion.\n\n\"With PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons,\" he said. \"With that increased firepower, the Finding Nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive.\" Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. \"Our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions.\" EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. \"Nobody queues for music anymore.\"\n\n\"You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,\" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.\n\nJan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. \"One idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show',\" said Mr Bolz.\n\nHe also said EA was planning an international awards show \"similar to the Oscars and the Grammys\" which would combine video games, music and movies. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. \"People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them.\" Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s. \"There's an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. \"If that's true, that's a big challenge for TV broadcasters - because watching TV is the biggest pastime at present.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the significance of EA's goal to become the world's largest entertainment company?\nWhat are EA's best selling games in Britain and why do they think this is relevant?\nWhat challenges might EA face while trying to become the world's largest entertainment company?\nDoes being a successful video game publisher mean being a successful movie producer?\nWhat will an international awards show combining video games, music, and movies entail?"}
{"prompt": "Tech helps disabled speed demons\n\nAn organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.\n\nThe Motorsport Endeavour Club left the starting grid yesterday at the Autosport International 2005 show at Birmingham's NEC, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.\n\nMotorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. \"I needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg,\" Mr Tansley told the BBC News website. \"In simple terms, I needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a Heath Robinson device.\" Mr Tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing's governing body, the Autocycle Union. \"At that time they wouldn't let any amputee race at all, but eventually they told me I could have a licence as long as I raced sidecars.\" Mr Tansley's invention, the Pro-Shift, is designed to work with Hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT. As a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. \"I'm not prejudiced, I'll sell to able-bodied people if I have to!\" he joked.\n\nAnother exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. The vehicle belongs to ParaRallying, the world's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in Lincolnshire.\n\n\"We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company,\" said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. \"The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we've yet to turn anybody away.\" Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. ParaRallying uses a Vauxhall Astra GSI with an automatic gearbox and manual Subaru Imprezas. The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. It also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.\n\nWhen Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion.\n\nAnd it was Rainey Senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. She uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals, a cushion behind her back and raising the seat. \"But in a competition car you have to have everything right or you'll lose the balance of the car,\" she said. \"I bring everything back to me - steering wheel, steering column, gear lever and pedals.\" When she recently took part in the London to Sydney Marathon she shared the driving with her partner, Trevor, who now does the engineering work. He designed a system for their Morris Minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute.

{"prompt": "Intel unveils laser breakthrough\n\nIntel has said it has found a way to put a silicon-based laser on a chip, raising hopes of much faster networks.\n\nScientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We've overcome a fundamental limit,\" said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.\n\nTelecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. \"We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,\" said Dr Paniccia. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. \"It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,\" he said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. \"It's a technical validation that it can work,\" he said.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the benefits of using silicon for laser light amplification?\nWhat does the breakthrough consist of?\nWhen will products be seen that utilize this breakthrough?\nWhy has it been so difficult to use silicon for laser light amplification?\nWhat would it take to develop semi-conductor lasers that can process and transmit light in a wide range of frequencies?"}

Mr Ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of Renault, which owns 44% of the Japanese carmaker, in April. Mr Ghosn transformed Nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business.\n\nMr Shiga will nominally serve as Mr Ghosn's deputy. However, he will be Nissan's most senior Japan-based executive and will be in charge of the firm's global sales and marketing.\n\nHe is currently in charge of Nissan's operations across Asia and Australasia and is credited with significantly improving its sales in China. He will inherit a strong legacy from Mr Ghosn, who has overseen a dramatic turnaround in Nissan's fortunes in the past five years. Dubbed 'le cost killer' for pushing through huge cost cuts in previous jobs, Mr Ghosn reduced Nissan's overheads by 20% and trimmed its workforce by about 200,000 after taking charge in 1999. These actions helped Nissan turn a 684bn yen ($6.4bn) loss in 2000 into a 331bn yen ($2.7bn) profit the following year. During his tenure, Nissan has increased its market share and made significant strides in key export markets. Nissan aims to increase vehicle sales to more than four million by 2008, launching 28 new models in the process.\n\nIn his new job as Renault chief executive, Mr Ghosn will devote 40% of his time to Renault, 40% to Nissan and the rest to the group's activities in North America and other key markets.\n\nMr Ghosn said Mr Shiga's appointment would ensure a \"seamless\" transition in management. \"I need a leadership team capable of accelerating the performance and delivery of results that has characterized Nissan over the past six years,\" Mr Ghosn said. \"I have full confidence in Toshiyuki Shiga and the new leadership team to help me implement the next chapter of Nissan's growth.\" Nissan also announced a number of other management appointments with promotions for several younger executives.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Does a CEO (chairman and chief executive) of Renault have obligations to the Nissan board of directors?\nIs Mr Ghosn right for both companies in his dual positions?\nWhat are the implications for Renault's shareholders that Nissan does not have its own management team in place?\nWhat is Mr Ghosn's end game for Renault share holders and Nissan managers, employees, and shareholders?\nHow much time should he devote to each company?\nWill all Nissan executives stay on with the company or will there be a brain drain?"}

BT Retail has announced that it will trial the same speed service, with a national rollout by year end. Other service providers are expected to follow suit and a glut of new voice and video services will follow.\n\n\"If the bandwidth is there then ISPs will buy it,\" said Jill Finger, a research director at analyst firm IDC. Others will be watching BT Retail's trials, which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers, with interest. For BT Retail, she said, the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players. \"It has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back,\" said Ms Finger. Wanadoo is set to trial an 8Mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services - which means it takes over the network from BT - which will provide speeds of up to 15Mbps.

{"prompt": "What price for 'trusted PC security'?\n\nYou can now buy \"trusted computers\", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson.\n\nIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based.\n\nAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.\n\nHardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, \"Longhorn\". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the \"Next Generation Secure Computing Base\", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide.\n\nBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.\n\nBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.\n\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the advantages of computer security using trusted hardware?\nWhat are the disadvantages of computer security using trusted hardware?\nWhy would recording some shows, and other programmed that have been recorded, be automatically deleted after a day because of changes made to TiVo's software?\nWhat does \"trusted computing\" mean?\nWho determines whether or not an \"unlocked version leaks?\""}

{"prompt": "Cabs collect mountain of mobiles\n\nGadgets are cheaper, smaller and more common than ever. But that just means we are more likely to lose them.\n\nIn London alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. That works out at about three phones per cab. Over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs such as Palms and Pocket PCs were left in licensed cabs. Even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. Jemima Khan reportedly left her iPod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be Hugh Grant. As the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. The numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.\n\nThis has left Londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Pointsec, a mobile-data backup firm. More than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in London as in any of the nine other cities (Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Chicago and Sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. By contrast Danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in Germans, Norwegians and Swedes. Top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. Given that few people back up the data on their PC it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. You could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.\n\nEqually, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. This growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as Retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. Briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the Mobile Equipment National Database that lets you register the unique ID number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. According to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. Millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as Transport For London regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. For the drivers, finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. The survey of what else has been left behind included a harp, a dog, a hamster and a baby.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What percentage of devices were left in black cabs in London versus other cities?\nWhat is the average price for a new device?\nHow do these numbers compare to historical statistics?\nWhere does the mobile equipment national database come from?\nIs everyone who loses a phone registered in this database?\nAre passengers required to register a device in order to ride with some companies, for example, airlines?\nHow can consumers protect themselves against theft if they do not register their device in the mobile equipment national database and do not back up any information on their personal computer or phone?"}
{"prompt": "Mobile music challenges 'iPod age'\n\nNokia and Microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets, while Sony Ericsson has unveiled its phone Walkman and Motorola is working on an iTunes phone.\n\nCan mobile phones replace the MP3 player in your pocket? The music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. Ease of use, relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of MP3 players.\n\nFull-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. But the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated MP3 players are numbered.\n\nGilles Babinet, chief executive of mobile music firm Musiwave, said: \"Music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music.\"\n\nMusiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and Mr Babinet said the industry was enjoying \"definite momentum.\" But there are hurdles to overcome. Mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival Apple's 60GB iPod. But the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs. \"We are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices,\" Jonas Guest, vice president for entertainment at Nokia, told the BBC News website. But will mobiles become mere storage devices? \"One of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while PCs are used for downloading,\" said Mr Babinet\n\n\"We don't want people to cast aside their PCs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems,\" explained Mr Guest. \"You must enable people to transfer music from a PC to a handset and vice versa.\"\n\nOne of the key elements of the Nokia and Microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a PC. Microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. Songs can be downloaded on PC or mobile and transferred between the platforms. \"The line between online and wireless is going to blur,\" predicted Ted Cohen, senior vice president of digital development and distribution at EMI. He said: \"The market is more regional in its maturity. In Asia it is beyond belief. \"The majority of our digital revenues in Asia comes from mobiles. In North America it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in Europe.\"\n\nEMI currently offers its entire 200,000 download catalogue for use by both by PCs and mobile phones. Mr Cohen said: \"It's going to be just as important to connect through 3G or wireless as it is through your PC. \"We want music to be a continuum.\" The seamless experience of mobiles and PC downloads is approaching, he predicted. Mr Babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over PCs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. \"Getting music from your PC onto a device is not an easy experience. You have to switch the PC on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music. \"All of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone.\" He said the mobile phone's billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads, because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group.\n\n\"Certainly, we have a problem with battery, memory and bandwidth. But it's not about the current status. It's about the potential. \"You will have all of your music on your mobile.\" All three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market. Mr Cohen said: \"I can send you the song and it is either billed to me or I send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep, it is billed to you. \"It's a social phenomenon.\" Mr Babinet said: \"Today you use radio and TV to discover music. Tomorrow you will discover and consume music via one device - the mobile.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How can mobile phones replace MP3 players?\nHow has the music download market been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution?\nWill full-length music downloads on mobile phones take off so quickly?\nWhat are some of the difficulties with mobile phones and music downloads?\nWhat have Nokia and Microsoft agreed to do in regards to mobile music downloading?\nWhat are some advantages that phones have over PCs when it comes to music downloading?\nHow is the idea of a seamless experience for PC and phone downloads an emerging phenomenon?"}
{"prompt": "Video phones act as dating tools\n\nTechnologies, from e-mail, to net chatrooms, instant messaging and mobiles, have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love.\n\nThe lure once was that you could hide behind the technology, but now video phones are in on the act to add vision. Hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world's first video mobile dating event. The top 100 meet their match on 30 November at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). The event, organised by the 3G network, 3, could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events, like speed dating, continues. \"It's the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it,\" said Graeme Oxby, 3's marketing director. The response has been so promising that 3 says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon. Hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles, and special booths were set up in a major London department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances. The 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ICA in separate rooms and \"meet\" by phone.\n\nDating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies. Whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen. Flic Everett, journalist and dating expert for Company magazine and the Daily Express, thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers. There are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the UK and three times more single people in Britain than there were 30 years ago, With more people buying video mobiles, 3G dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people.\n\n\"One of the problems with video phones is people don't really know what to video. It is a weird technology. We have not quite worked out what it is for. This gives it a focus and a useful one,\" she told BBC News. \"I would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did,\" she said. \"Lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face. Lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable.\" \"When you are writing, it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest.\" But the barrier that comes with SMS chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are. Scare stories have put people off as a result, according to Ms Everett. Many physical clues, body language, odd twitches, are obviously missing with SMS and online dating services. Still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues. \"It could really take off because you do get the whole package. With a static e-mail picture, you don't know who the person is behind it is.\" So checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier, an extra layer of protection; a case of WLTS before WLTM. \"If you are trapped in real-life blind date context, you can't get away and you feel embarrassed. \"With a video meeting, you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don't like them you don't have to suffer the embarrassment.\"\n\nThere is a more serious side to this new use of technology though. With money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat, the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3G, thinks Paolo Pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts IDC. \"Wireless is a medium that is being exploited with a number of features and services. One is chatting and the dating element is key there,\" he said. \"The foundation has been set by SMS and companies are using media like MMS and video to grow the market further.\" But carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such 3G dating services, they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis, he cautioned. In July, Vodafone introduced a content control system to protect children from such adult content. The move was as a result of a code of practice agreed by the UK's six largest mobile phone operators in January. The system means Vodafone users need to prove they are over 18 before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes. The impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net, and the growth of 3G technologies.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the benefits of video phones when looking for love?\nWhat has happened to dating because of the internet and mobile phones?\nWhy is \"being honest\" in person important when looking for a partner?\nWho is 3G aimed at?"}
{"prompt": "Camera phones are 'must-haves'\n\nFour times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\n\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\n\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\n\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\n\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\n\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Does it go against the individual's right to privacy?\nDo policies need to be created for schools, fitness centers, and local councils about the use of camera phones?\nIs image quality an issue in using camera phones?\nWhat other technological developments are being made in camera phones?\nWould this exhibition be considered art or photography?"}

Depending on how much they borrow or invest, members earn \"reward\" points which entitle them to a share of the society's profits. The payouts are bigger than last year, because of stricter eligibility rules. Last year, Britannia members shared \u00a342m, but the average payment was only \u00a338.\n\nTo qualify for this year's payment, customers must have been members for at least two years on 31 December 2004.

{"prompt": "Economy 'strong' in election year\n\nUK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.\n\nOptimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said. Its BDO's output index - which predicts GDP movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for January, implying GDP growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. However, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. Its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in January from 108.0 in October last year. \"The UK is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the Bank of England reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward. \"Growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What would trigger an interest rate increase?\nWhat are the consequences of interest rate increases on the UK economy?\nWhat are the consequences of high oil prices for business?\nDo businesses need to prepare themselves for a \"jolt\"?"}
{"prompt": "Making your office work for you\n\nOur mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time, we're taking a long hard look at your offices.\n\nOver the next few months, our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work, and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient, more congenial or simply prettier. This week, we're hearing from Marianne Petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. Click on the link under her photograph to read her story, and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. And if you want to take part in the series, go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.\n\nWorking from home presents a multitude of challenges. Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others? Are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done? Do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. It may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit, and to keep strict office hours. Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. It is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours, keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. Joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected.\n\n\n\nPrior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.\n\nIdeally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. This would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. Ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. The owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. Use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.\n\n\n\nPlease click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn.\n\nThe layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.\n\n\n\nRegarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house, your plan of going wireless is sensible. A wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient. However, important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass, which could result in a weak signal strength. You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. Your local IT supplier will be able to advise on this. If you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software, it is essential to do so, to protect your investment. To really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. Or you could use one of the new Tablet computers, which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. And finally, you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print, scan, copy and fax.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the purpose of this office?\nWhat are the challenges associated with remote working environments?\nWhat are considerations for creating a remote office that will be both efficient and comfortable for employees and visitors?\nHow do you think this space would function according to what is outlined in the passage?"}
{"prompt": "Market unfazed by Aurora setback\n\nAs the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.\n\nThe ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for Carnival's share price, from \u00a335 to \u00a336.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT Carnival's shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at \u00a332.26.\n\nWhy the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? \"The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. \"It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.\"\n\nDespite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion.\n\nSimilarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.\n\nAssuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival's favour. In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How is the market responding to the setback?\nWhy is there a mismatch between the public perception and the market's response?\nWhat responsibility does the company have for informing the public about such things as health scares or technical troubles with its ships?\nWhen can markets be trusted to make wise decisions?\nHow does Carnival Corporation respond to instances of technical difficulties with its ships?\nIs it only important what happens to Aurora, or are all Carnival Ships impacted by this event?"}
{"prompt": "BT offers equal access to rivals\n\nBT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.\n\nThe move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors \"real equality of access to its phone lines\". At the time, Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two. Ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the UK telecom sector. BT's competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm.\n\nThis latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of a deadline for the second phase of its review.\n\n\"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT's local network,\" the former monopoly said in a statement. \"The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,\" BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said. \"BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,\" he said. BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat.\n\nThe group is to set up a new Access Services division - with a separate board which would include independent members - to ensure equal access for rivals to the \"local loop\", the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households. The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from April in areas of high customer demand.\n\nIt added that it plans to invest \u00a310bn in the next five years to create a \"21st Century network\". To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.\n\nTelecom analysts Ovum welcomed the move, saying BT had \"given a lot of ground\".\n\n\"The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,\" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said. Internet service provider (ISP) Plus.net also backed the proposals saying \"we will be entirely happy if Ofcom accepts them\". \"BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider,\" chief executive Lee Strafford said. Chris Panayis, managing director of ISP Freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. \"I think it's the first productive thing we've had from BT,\" he said.\n\nAOL backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field. \"This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,\" a spokesman said. \"Ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [IPStream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.\" More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase.

{"prompt": "Latin America sees strong growth\n\nLatin America's economy grew by 5.5% in 2004, its best performance since 1980, while exports registered their best performance in two decades.\n\nThe United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said the region grew by 5.5% this year. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) said regional exports reached $445.1bn (\u00a3227bn;331bn euros) in 2004. Doubts about the strength of the US recovery and overheating of the Chinese economy do however pose risks for 2005. Both organisations also warned that high oil prices raise the risk of either inflation or recession.\n\nNevertheless, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) still forecasts growth of 4% for 2005. Strong recovery in some countries, such as Venezuela and Uruguay, boosted the overall performance of the region. ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years. Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products. In fact, Latin American exports to China grew 34%, to $14bn. Higher oil prices also helped boost exports, as Mexico and Venezuela are important oil exporters.

{"prompt": "Asia shares defy post-quake gloom\n\nIndonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.\n\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. \"[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"\n\nIndia's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\n\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (\u00a3398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\n\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this.

{"prompt": "Split-caps pay \u00a3194m compensation\n\nInvestors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive \u00a3194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.\n\nEighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\n\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\n\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to \u00a3350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the implications of the settlement not including two firms?\nWhat is the FSA?\nWhat were the results of the FSA's investigation?\nWhat is the story of the splitcapital investment trust scandal?\nWhich of these 18 firms have agreed to pay what the FSA described as \"substantial\" compensation?\nWhat does this mean for investors who were affected?"}

The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant.\n\nSo far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by China's State Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. The China Three Gorges Project Corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; \u00a312,700). Last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. \"The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,\" it said.\n\nThe Sepa order comes as the Chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country's booming economy. Previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (MW). The Xiluodu Dam is designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity, and is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \"river of golden sand\" as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known.

{"prompt": "Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction\n\nA little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.\n\nBaikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: \u00a34.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\n\n\"The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \"every lawful move\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\n\nThe sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\n\nMystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\n\n\"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\n\nThe US bankruptcy court's initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": ""}

The company, China's third-largest milk producer, is to hold an emergency meeting to debate the issue. A Yili spokesman said it may now move to oust chairman Zheng Junhuai. The spokesman did not say why the three had been detained by the police. The official Xinhua News Agency said the arrest was linked to alleged embezzlement.\n\nYili has recently been the subject of intense media speculation over its financial operations.

The tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and Indonesia worst hit. Some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. Millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.\n\nEconomists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. For Thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. Governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.\n\n\"With the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,\" Glenn Maguire, chief economist for the region at Societe Generale, told Agence France Presse. \"The economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,\" he said. \"First and foremost this is a human tragedy.\" India's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. The regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. But India now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.\n\nThailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). Analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. Thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by Sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from Malaysia to Africa. Malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be \"significant\", Agence France Presse reported.

Green groups say putting pressure on supply chains is a major way companies can reduce their environmental impact. The survey is published by corporate social responsibility firm Context and branding firm SalterBaxter.\n\nBlake Lee-Harwood, campaigns director at Greenpeace in the UK, said: \"It's fairly meaningless to talk about your company's direction in terms of sustainability without having detailed knowledge of your supply chain. \"It's also important to get some kind of independent assessment of your reporting.\"\n\nLess than a quarter of companies (24%) get their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports independently verified to provide assurances they are accurate and complete, says the survey. To date there are no set standards for non-financial reporting, although the Global Reporting Initiative, an independent pro-sustainability institution, is planning to establish some. The reports surveyed by Directions are published voluntarily. They are usually called corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, sustainability reports, or social and environmental reports.\n\nPeter Knight, director of Context, says 24 UK top 250 companies reported for the first time this year and, in general, the quality of reports has improved. \"The corporate lexicon of homilies, generalities and soft assurances - fluff - is on its way out.

{"prompt": "Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets\n\nIndia's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\n\n\"We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,\" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (\u00a31bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\n\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\n\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC's plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin's recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\n\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia's Siberian coast.\n\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\n\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why are they interested in Yukos?\nWhat do they want to do with Yugansk?\nWho else is interested in the assets?\nWhy did Russia take over Yukos and what are the consequences for Yukos shareholders, employees, and stakeholders?\nWhat will be ONGC's strategy if the US court turns down Yukos' bankruptcy petition on 16 February 2006?"}
{"prompt": "Monsanto fined $1.5m for bribery\n\nThe US agrochemical giant Monsanto has agreed to pay a $1.5m (\u00a3799,000) fine for bribing an Indonesian official.\n\nMonsanto admitted one of its employees paid the senior official two years ago in a bid to avoid environmental impact studies being conducted on its cotton. In addition to the penalty, Monsanto also agreed to three years' close monitoring of its business practices by the American authorities. It said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities.\n\nA former senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in Indonesia's environment ministry in 2002. The manager told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as \"consulting fees\".\n\nMonsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in Indonesia. Despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002.\n\nThe chemicals-and-crops firm said it became aware of irregularities at a Jakarta-based subsidiary in 2001 and launched an internal investigation before informing the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Monsanto faced both criminal and civil charges from the Department of Justice and the SEC. \"Companies cannot bribe their way into favourable treatment by foreign officials,\" said Christopher Wray, assistant US attorney general. Monsanto has agreed to pay $1m to the Department of Justice, adopt internal compliance measures, and co-operate with continuing civil and criminal investigations. It is also paying $500,000 to the SEC to settle the bribe charge and other related violations. Monsanto said it accepted full responsibility for its employees' actions, adding that it had taken \"remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia\" and had been \"fully co-operative\" throughout the investigative process.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What did Monsanto bribe?\nHow much did Monsanto pay for the bribe?\nWho is being bribed?\nWhat is Monsanto trying to avoid?\nHow does this affect farmers, activists, and the environment?\nWhat are the impacts on other people besides those in Indonesia (e.g., employees in Monsanto)?\nDo US authorities have any dealings with Indonesian authorities about Monsanto's activities in Indonesia since then?"}
{"prompt": "WorldCom bosses' $54m payout\n\nTen former directors at WorldCom have agreed to pay $54m (\u00a328.85m), including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit, reports say.\n\nJames Wareham, a lawyer representing one of the directors, told Reuters the 10 had agreed to pay those who lost billions when the firm collapsed. The remaining $36m will be paid by the directors' insurers. But, a spokesman for the prosecutor, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, said no formal agreement had been made.\n\nCorporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement, it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses, when the firms they oversee face problems.\n\n\"Directors very rarely pay,\" said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. He added that the settlement \"sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world\". A formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on Thursday in a US district court in Manhattan. Earlier, the New York Times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. The ten former outside directors are James Allen, Judith Areen, Carl Aycock, Max Bobbitt, Clifford Alexander, Stiles Kellett, Gordon Macklin, John Porter, Lawrence Tucker and the estate of John Sidgmore, who died last year. It has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay. \"None of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the WorldCom fraud,\" said the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\n\nTwo other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper. According to the WSJ, which cites people familiar to the case, the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations. The second-largest US long-distance telecoms operator filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when an $11bn accounting scandal was unearthed. The company emerged from Chapter 11 protection last year and changed its name to MCI Inc. Former WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How much of the settlement is being paid by the defendants and how much is being paid by the directors' insurers?\nHow are the settling defendants planning to distribute the money?\nWhy do you think the settling defendants have decided to pay out of their own pockets?\nWhat does a cash settlement from directors say about accountability for breaches of duty when they oversee a firm that faces problems?\nThe New York Times reported earlier that when negotiations first started, it was reported that as part of any deal, personal payments were required.

{"prompt": "Iran budget seeks state sell-offs\n\nIran's president, Mohammad Khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the Islamic republic's dependence on oil.\n\nThe budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 March calls for the sell-off of 20% of the state's corporate holdings. Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget. But opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. Elections in May 2004 ousted many of Mr Khatami's supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. The ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by Turkish companies, which hardliners accused of doing business with Israel. It came not long after the Expediency Council - Iran's ultimate decision-maker - blessed Mr Khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues.\n\nIn an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year. He said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1,546 trillion rials ($175.6bn; \u00a393.6bn) from the previous year's 1,070 trillion. Within that figure, taxation would rise to $14.3bn, a rise of over 40% from what is expected from the current year. In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005. \"Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,\" Mr Khatami said. \"Oil revenues should be used for productive investment.\" Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Would it be moral to continue a government policy that affects the welfare of citizens when they do not agree with it, even if it may seem more ethical to certain populations?\nWill this change in Iran's economy help or hurt the country over time and are there any other factors?\nWhat do you think might happen to prices as a result of these budget changes?\nWould this type of shift from oil revenue to tax revenues create an easier environment for investment or is it more difficult for investment because the risk of higher taxation would create uncertainty?"}

Barclays has declined to comment on the report in the Sunday Express, saying it does not respond to market speculation. The two banks reportedly held talks in October and November 2004.\n\nBarclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in London on Monday, making it the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index. UK banking icon Barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it has operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide. Its North American divisions focus on business banking, whereas Wells Fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches.

The move follows News Corp's decision to register its business in the US. 20th Century Fox's recent film releases include I Heart Huckabees and I, Robot, while Fox puts out hit TV series 24.\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, minority Fox shareholders will receive 1.90 News Corp shares in return for each Fox share they hold. Analysts said the decision to list News Corp in the US - which will result in the firm's shares trading in New York rather than Sydney- nullified the need to retain a separate stock market listing for Fox Entertainment shares. News Corp investors voted in October to approve the transfer of the company's corporate domicile from Australia to the US state of Delaware. The move is designed to help News Corp attract more investment from the largest US financial institutions, and make it easier to raise capital.

{"prompt": "Chinese exports rise 25% in 2004\n\nExports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.\n\nThe spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; \u00a3165bn).\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors.

Parmalat was placed into bankruptcy protection in 2003 after a 14bn euro black hole was found in its accounts. More than 130,000 people lost money following the firm's collapse. Mr Tanzi, 66, issued a statement through his lawyer after five hours of questioning by prosecutors in Parma on 15 January.\n\nProsecutors are seeking indictments against Mr Tanzi and 28 others - including several members of his family and former Parmalat chief financial officer Fausto Tonna - for alleged manipulation of stock market prices and making misleading statements to accountants and Italy's financial watchdog.

The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.\n\nSports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; \u00a326). The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic.

Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. Both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. American, the world's biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.\n\nAMR's shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. AMR's chief executive Gerard Arpey said the airline's difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. \"AMR's results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,\" he said. For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003's $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. AMR added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 Boeing jets.

Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. Deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover.\n\nPreviously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies.

The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.\n\nOne company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce.\n\nOver the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection, coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids. Over 90% of the 2,200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. \"Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,\" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.\n\n\"Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,\" he said. \"Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.\" Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The gap is even wider in China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia, the so-called \"next wave\" countries, which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV/Aids cases worldwide by 2010. The report adds \"an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,\" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nThe WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why did the study conclude that more than 90% of employees with HIV who were on the company's treatment plan were well and had returned to normal work?\nWhy was there a decline in concern among businesses about the disease in the last 12 months despite 14,000 people contracting it every day?\nWhat is one step that businesses could take to be more aware of their potential risks and vulnerabilities to HIV?\nWhy is it important for companies to understand their HIV/Aids risks?\nWhat specific measures are some companies taking to combat HIV/Aids?\nIs a key priority of the WEF report for businesses to establish a policy based on nondiscrimination and confidentiality?"}

The move follows a decision earlier this month by Anil - the younger brother of Reliance Group president Mukesh Ambani - to resign from his post. His resignation was not accepted by his brother, who is also the boss of IPCL. The IPCL board met in Mumbai to discuss the company's results for the October-to-December quarter.\n\nIt is understood that the board also considered Anil's resignation and asked him to reconsider his decision. However, Anil's demand that Anand Jain - another IPCL board member accused by Anil of creating a rift in the Ambani family - be thrown out, was not met. Anil has accused Anand Jain, a confidant of his brother Mukesh, of playing a negative role in the Ambani family, and being responsible for the trouble between the brothers. On Wednesday, the board of Reliance Energy, another Reliance Group company, reaffirmed its faith in Anil, who is the company's chief. Reliance Group acquired the government's 26% stake in IPCL - India's second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002, as part of the privatisation drive. Meanwhile, the group's flagship company, Reliance Industries, has its board meeting on Friday to consider its financial results. Mukesh is the company's chairman and Anil its deputy, and it is expected that both brothers will come face to face in the meeting.

{"prompt": "Bad weather hits Nestle sales\n\nA combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish European economy has hit sales at Swiss food and drink giant Nestle.\n\nRevenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; \u00a339.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer. However, Nestle's profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\n\nNestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\n\nElsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. Nestle's total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; \u00a3451m). Looking forward, Nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.\n\nUncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle. Perrier has been locked in a long-standing dispute with unions about productivity levels at the business, which has lead Nestle to consider selling the firm. \"The option of selling is Perrier is still on the table,\" chief executive Peter Brabeck-Letmathe confirmed on Thursday.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "When did bad weather, increased costs and sluggish economic conditions start affecting Nestle's sales?\nWhat are some of the specific areas where the company saw a decline in sales?\nWhat is Nestle doing to try to offset this dip in revenue?\nWhat effect will bad weather for Nestle's European customers have on its revenues?\nWill Nestle be able to surpass last year's strong performance given rising oil prices and instability in the Middle East, African and Asian countries?"}
{"prompt": "Trial begins of Spain's top banker\n\nThe trial of Emilio Botin, the chairman of Spain's most powerful bank, Santander Central Hispano, has started in Madrid.\n\nMr Botin is accused of misusing the bank's funds after he approved the payment of 160m euros ($208m; \u00a3111m) in bonus and pension payouts to two former executives. However, the trial was suspended when Mr Botin's lawyer introduced a new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin. A three-judge panel gave prosecution lawyers until Monday to study the documents, when the trial will be reconvened.\n\nThe high-profile case began after two Santander shareholders filed a criminal complaint about the payments to Jose Maria Amusategui and Angel Corcostegui, who stepped down in 2001. Both executives helped Mr Botin orchestrate Spain's biggest bank merger, between Santander and Banco Central Hispano, in 1999. As he arrived at Spain's High Court earlier on Wednesday, Mr Botin greeted the waiting media, saying: \"I have full faith in justice.\" Santander's board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. But if convicted, Mr Botin could face a prison term of up to six years. Mr Corcostegui, a former CEO at Santander, also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted. In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the \u00a38.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National.

{"prompt": "Italy to get economic action plan\n\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome.\n\nHe will present an \"Action Plan for the Development of Italy\" in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT.\n\nThe government has been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to a \"brain-drain\" of the country's brightest talents. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy's corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nThe government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on \"opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system\".\n\nMr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; \u00a34.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. He has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel. Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy's problems worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.\n\nThe country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years. Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy's economy.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Did the government under-fund R&D?\nIs hiring and firing staff too difficult and expensive?\nShould bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses?\nWhat is the responsibility of Italy's 60 million population in getting economic growth going?"}

All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a \u00a325,000 prize. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening.\n\nBookmaker William Hill has placed London-based Levy's novel as the 6/4 favourite to win.\n\nSmall Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London.

It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,\" wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: \"It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. \"Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch.\"\n\nIn the biography category it was John Guy's The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner.

{"prompt": "Worldcom ex-boss launches defence\n\nLawyers defending former WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.\n\nCynthia Cooper, WorldCom's ex-head of internal accounting, alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the US telecoms giant in 2002. Her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (\u00a35.7bn) accounting fraud. Mr Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nProsecution lawyers have argued that Mr Ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at WorldCom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet Wall Street earnings estimates. But Ms Cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in New York on Wednesday that external auditors Arthur Andersen had approved WorldCom's accounting in early 2001 and 2002. She said Andersen had given a \"green light\" to the procedures and practices used by WorldCom. Mr Ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.\n\nMs Cooper also said that during shareholder meetings Mr Ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only \"brief\" answers himself. The prosecution's star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to \"hit our books\". However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned \"anything uncomfortable\" about WorldCom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI.

Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist. \"The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix's house,\" said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation. The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved. Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre. Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.\n\n\"We never said, 'You can own this property,'\" said John Franklin, chief of its operations department. \"From our perspective, it was a temporary situation. We have not threatened to demolish the house. We've simply asked that they have to move it.\" Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle's central district, where Hendrix grew up. Janie Hendrix, the guitarist's stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him. \"That's something my father really wanted to see,\" she said. \"It would be nice if we didn't have to fight for everything to get it.\" Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time.

{"prompt": "Deadline nears for Fiat-GM deal\n\nFiat and General Motors (GM) have until midnight on 1 February to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover.\n\nThe deadline marks the point at which Fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to GM, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (\u00a31.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat's decision to sell off Fiat's finance arm and halve GM's stake via a capital-raising effort.\n\nThe 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GM's offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a \"put option\". Since then, however, Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GM's stake in half to 10%. For its part, GM's European units Opel and Saab have both had trouble, with Opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs. \"The last thing they need is additional production capacity in Europe,\" said Patrick Juchemich, auto analyst at Sal Oppenheim Bank.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How has the agreement between Fiat and GM evolved?\nWhat led GM to no longer want to own Fiat as a result of the partnership established in 2000?\nWhat impact will the expiration of this agreement have on GM's European operations?\nDid GM and Fiat ever agree on the put option?\nWhat caused Fiat's fall in stock price?\nDid the talks stall due to GM's offer or Fiat's decision to sell off its finance arm and halve GM's stake via a capitalraising effort?\nHas there been any chance that Fiat may not have lost any ground in Europe in the past decade?\nIs it likely that Opel management will cut 12,000 jobs?"}

{"prompt": "DJ double act revamp chart show\n\nDJ duo JK and Joel are taking over BBC Radio 1's flagship chart show on Sunday, adding showbiz news, celebrity interviews and between-song banter.\n\nThey hope to boost ratings for the long-running show, which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radio's Hit 40 UK rundown. \"Radio 1's chart show is an institution and remains the station's single most popular show,\" says JK, also known as Jason King. \"For years people have been tuning in at four o'clock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes. Not that I ever did that. \"But things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change.\"\n\nThat change involved ejecting previous host Wes Butters and relocating King and DJ partner Joel Ross from their weekend afternoon Radio 1 slot. The pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on Viking Radio in Hull before moving to Manchester station Key 103 and winning two Sony Radio awards. They also presented gadget series Playboyz and car show Motor Maniacs for cable TV channel Granada Men and Motors, and Pure Soap on BBC Three.\n\nOn the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and DVD charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. \"The chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme,\" says Ross. \"The show used to be the only way to discover who was in the Top 40. Now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too.\" The show's reduced reliance upon the Top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.\n\n\"I personally buy downloads rather than CD singles,\" says 27-year-old Ross. \"Even my grandma can download songs now. JK is still struggling with the technology, though.\" \"But it's premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead,\" Ross adds. \"While sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from April. \"Music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week.\"\n\nRoss will be plumping for chart success from rapper Verbalicious and the Stereophonics on Sunday, while King is more of an R&B and dance music fan. \"So listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes,\" says King, 30, who describes outgoing host Butters as \"an extremely professional and competent broadcaster\".\n\n\"The advantage Joel and I have is that we're a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive,\" King says. \"Wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. And if not, I could always use a cleaner,\" he jokes. Ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show. \"Other people can worry about that, we are going to continue doing what we do well,\" he says. \"At the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining.

{"prompt": "Bangkok film festival battles on\n\nOrganisers of the third Bangkok International Film Festival have been determined to carry on with this year's event despite the ravages of the Asian tsunami disaster.\n\nThe festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival's executive director, Craig Prater. \"The decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\n\n\"Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"But we feel like we've turned a page. We've acknowledged our position, and now it's business as usual.\"\n\nMr Prater's sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. \"We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\n\n\"However, the nation's recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"We are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.\n\nThe eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.\n\nOn a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.\n\nBut the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival's Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December's catastrophe. \"I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the British actor said. \"I thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then I spoke to the organisers and I was encouraged to let life go on. \"Now I've come here I'm very glad. What impresses me about Thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,\" he continued. \"Basically I was invited here by Thailand. If they still want you to come, you should.\"\n\nNow in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, Mr Prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"It's grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"We've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the festival is still a baby. \"I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world.\" The Golden Kinnarees will be awarded on Friday. The festival itself runs until 24 January.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the significance of Bangkok as a film festival locale?\nWhy has this year's attendance been so low?\nWhat will happen at the Golden Kinnaree awards?\nWhy has Ray Charles biopic Ray been invited to the festival?"}

The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (\u00a317.7 billion). The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. On average every Briton buys 3.2 CDs per person per year.\n\nAround 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK. \"A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans' demand for great music,\" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The best-selling album globally was Usher's Confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004.\n\nThe growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. The total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003.

{"prompt": "Bening makes awards breakthrough\n\nFilm actress Annette Bening is up for an Oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia.\n\nBening, who was born in Texas in 1958, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywood's favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening's role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999's American Beauty. But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank's leading role in Boys Don't Cry. After opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. She then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988's The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy.\n\nFollowing a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening's breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won her an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award.\n\nHowever the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood's greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.\n\nBugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe. The couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening's career in the mid-1990s. She played Michael Douglas' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a \"fiery\" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\nBening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance. But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Was Bening born in Texas?\nWhat was the first big award that Bening won?\nWhy did Annette Bening star in American Beauty?\nDid she win the Academy Award for her performance in Being Julia?"}

{"prompt": "'Errors' doomed first Dome sale\n\nThe initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.\n\nThe report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers \u00a328.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than \u00a3550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.\n\nThe NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What was the first attempt to sell the Dome like?\nWhat does this passage say about the first sale attempt for the Dome?\nWhen did it close?\nWho owns it now?\nWhat happens to the money from the second sale?"}

{"prompt": "PM apology over jailings\n\nTony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.\n\nThe prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\".\n\nThe families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. \"You could see he was moved by what people were saying. \"Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It's a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them\".\n\nMost of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\n\"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven.

{"prompt": "Concerns at school diploma plan\n\nFinal appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.\n\nThe government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.\n\nHis main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.\n\nThe chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the concerns?\nWhat would a \"half-hearted response\" look like?\nIs a four-tier diploma better than GCSEs and A-levels for some people or not?\nHow will the government address the firms' concerns of insufficient skills, as well as the concerns of employers and schools?"}
{"prompt": "UK 'needs true immigration data'\n\nA former Home Office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor UK immigration.\n\nBarbara Roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. She said this would counter \"so-called independent\" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate. He says he opposes large-scale immigration \"both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture\".\n\nHe said: \"For example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. \"We are already more overcrowded than India and we are four times more overcrowded than France.\" Ms Roche, Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. She said her proposals mean \"we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.\" She went on: \"What I would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government. \"I think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.\"\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What \"independent\" groups does the passage mention?\nWhat is the \"debate\"?\nWhat does Ms. Roche propose?\nWhat are Barbara Roche's reasons for calling for the establishment of an independent immigration body?\nWhat steps, if any, should be taken to resolve the disagreements between Roche and Sir Andrew Green?\nDo you agree with her position?\nWhat would such a monitoring body do if it was set up?"}
{"prompt": "Blunkett sorry over murder plan\n\nDavid Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced \"prematurely\" via press release a review of murder laws.\n\nThe home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as \"a mess\". He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his \"gracious apology\" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to face MPs.\n\nIn its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be \"graded\" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.\n\nBut the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was \"indefensible and should cease\".\n\nA key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: \"Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. \"Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence.\" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who apologised to MPs and why?\nIs the commission review supposed to look at all types of murder in England and Wales or only some?\nWhat is the current opinion among criminal justice professionals on mandatory life sentences for all types of murder?\nWhat does the commission say it will do (or not do) in regard to partial defences to murder?\nWhat are different kind of murders classified as, according to the commission's report?\nDoes this classification have anything to do with the sentence imposed by a court, if found guilty of murder?"}

{"prompt": "Nuclear strike 'key terror risk'\n\nThe UK and US must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic.\n\nAmitai Etzioni, a key influence on New Labour thinking, says the US emphasis on an \"Axis of Evil\" is misplaced. The priority should instead be on \"failing states\", including Russia and Pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues. His report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology.\n\nProfessor Etzioni was a senior adviser to President Carter's White House and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of Blairite Third Way politics. In a report for the Foreign Policy Centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.\n\n\"Attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack,\" he says. That means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. \"We must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction,\" Prof Etzioni continues.\n\nHe suggests so-called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than \"failed and failing states\", which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. He names Russia as the \"failing state\" of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside America. And he is also worried about Pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted leaking nuclear secrets. Prof Etzioni criticises the US for overlooking those reports, suggesting it was done in return for Pakistani help in hunting Osama Bin Laden. \"This is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers,\" he says.\n\n\n - Upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure \n - Creating a new Global Safety Authority to tackle nuclear terrorism, using the intelligence links established in the wake of 11 September - backed by the United Nations' authority \n - Encouraging, pressuring and using \"all available means\" to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium \n - When possible, taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted \n - Compelling \"failing and rogue states\", and eventually all states, to destroy their nuclear bombs.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What does Professor Etzioni mean by a nuclear terrorist attack?\nWhat are some of the main dangers faced by many nations that will result from not taking action against nuclear terrorism?\nHow does the US, and what was or were their role in current international nuclear policy, not adequately take into account other problems that are more important to deal with right now?\nWhat is the significance of Axes of Evil as it pertains to Bin Laden's hunt and the likelihood of future terrorist attacks involving nuclear materials?"}
{"prompt": "EU China arms ban 'to be lifted'\n\nThe EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.\n\nThe 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.\n\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU's move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a \"product of the Cold War\". German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. \"I have long understood China's argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don't think it is,\" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said \"it is more likely than not\" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. \"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\"\n\nMr Straw said the US government was suspicious of \"the motives of some other countries within the EU\" in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washington's objections were based on a \"lack of information and understanding\" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And \"intense discussions\" were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What does the embargo prohibit?\nWhat has led the EU to consider lifting it now?\nWhy do they think the US government would be suspicious of this?\nHow would this affect Taiwan?\nWhat is Washington's stance on this issue?"}

The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a \"terrible\" waste of money. He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that \"billions\" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people \"out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease\". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to \"make history poverty\". He added: \"If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears.\" The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is \"worth, always, striving for\".\n\n\"How is it that peace has not arrived?,\" the cardinal will ask. \"How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?\" \"How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace?\" Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system.\n\nOn Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. \"It is possible, it is real, it is worth, always, striving for, because of the promise of Our Saviour,\" he will say. \"I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. \" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make.

The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. It is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 May.\n\nNext month's Budget will be Mr Brown's eighth since Labour came to power in 1997.

{"prompt": "Howard backs stem cell research\n\nMichael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.\n\nThe controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it. But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neurone disease. \"I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,\" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\n\nMr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research.

I'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. I still don't think I can go on, but I think I'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why did the author go to a hotel at the other end of the country to kill himself?\nWhy did the author quit his job?\nWhat has made the author so exhausted and sad?\nHow does the mother react to her son's plan to commit suicide?"}
{"prompt": "I tried to kill myself Friday\nI took as many pills as I could and washed them down with whiskey. Then I took a razor blade to my arm and cut it up until my arm and my basement was covered in blood. My parents found me and now I am at their house while they try to get me help. I survived and now I\u2019m looking ahead to the future. I must\u2019ve survived for a reason. It\u2019s going to be hard but I need to at least give this a chance. I hope all of you do as well.

{"prompt": "I spent 3 yrs writing this horror book, making a soundtrack for it, and making it viewable like a film. I put my heart into something that will go nowhere. I just want to fucking die. I\u2019ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus. I\u2019m so stressed\nI put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.\n\n\nI've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. \n\n\nAnd now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. \n\n\nI have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: \"I made this\" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called \"spam\" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying \"I made this\" to \"I found this.\" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)\n\nWhat else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these \"instapoets\"? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.\n\n\nI lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for. I always told myself I would die before being in this position. I try to have integrity and pride. This is just humiliating. And it was humiliating working at my previous job. Knowing I could have capable of so much more, knowing I could have done so much more with my life, that at one point I honestly had fans - even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me! And people were praising what I was doing in college...I feel like Nick Drake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOFgM3mFIqw\n\n\nI've never felt so hopeless and stressed out and like a loser and so many other things. There's a million other things. I have no money. I don't have money for rent next month. I don't have money for food. Some of you might not understand but I'd rather die than take unemployment benefits. I am more suicidal than you can possibly know. I am trapped. Stuck. I can't believe I'm 29 and in this position. All those dreams I had as a kid about being the next JK Rowling...I've been doing a lot of research. I have a method figured out. It seems almost inevitable that I will end it.

Like a safety net... but the opposite.  In my mind I would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  I would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  It was a huge help.\n\nRecently, I have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight I realized that if I was to end my life, it would completely break her.

{"prompt": "Literally dying inside\nMy partner of 16 years, and wife of 6 months, came home from a trip to Ireland to ask for a divorce. Completely out of the blue.

{"prompt": "I can't stop crying. I can't shut my brain up. I can't function and I can't stand it and I need to make it stop.\nI'm sorry this is so rambly and incoherent, I'm sobbing so fucking hard and I can barely breathe but I tried my best to make it make a little sense and to break it into paragraphs at least.\n\nLast week I got in an argument with someone I was close to and said things to them that really hurt them because I was hurting a lot myself.  It's things that I didn't and never ever would actually think or mean but they just spilled out because I was hurting and terrified and my brain just...broke.  I know that's no excuse, I hurt them and it's awful, that's all there is to it, I feel horrid and I always will.  But yeah, they said and did hurtful things too, it was bad on both ends.  I ended up in the hospital on a 72 hour hold.\n\nAs a sidenote I realized a few hours after the fact I'd forgotten to take my depression/anxiety/etc. meds the day of that fight and I hate myself so damn much.  If I ever forget them (which happens from time to time because I have quite severe ADHD that makes me very forgetful) I get especially sensitive and emotional and more prone to being a big whiny baby and if I'd just remembered to take them I'm 99% sure none of this would have happened but I'm so goddamn stupid and useless that I forgot and now everything's ruined due to my own fucking stupidity.\n\nAnyway.  I came home and things are ruined, people who used to say I'm amazing and wonderful are now saying I'm a bad person.  Everything I thought I knew about myself and others and my relationships and friendships has been completely shattered.  I don't know or understand how people who truly cared about me could change their opinion in a heartbeat.  I don't understand how people who claimed to love and care about me can be so indifferent to the fact I was in the damn hospital having a nervous breakdown over this.  I'm entirely lost and confused and broken, I don't know what ever was real anymore because I just don't understand how someone can go from \"you're amazing\" to \"you're a bad person\" in the span of days.  I have a couple other people still telling me \"no, no, you're wonderful, anyone who knows you knows you're the kindest and most selfless person there is with a heart of gold, fuck anyone who says otherwise\" but I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions.  I know I shouldn't depend on other people so much to base my worth or my opinion of myself but I'm really a weak person with no self esteem so it's really sometimes the only way I can gauge what kind of person I feel like I am.  If that makes any sense at all.\n\nI feel like I've lost so much.  People who meant so much to me.  Memories that I should be looking back on with fondness make me cry and panic and I get so scared and confused because I just don't understand.  Not just memories with the person in question but memories with ANYONE because it's like my whole sense of trust in people is gone.  I don't know what's real anymore.  I don't understand.  I've tried talking and doing everything I can to make it right and people refuse to listen.  I've been hurt so much by people and I always forgive because I understand that who we are when we're upset doesn't always reflect reality and what we actually think or feel, I know that saying things in the heat of the moment doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Being mean and hurtful in the heat of a fight doesn't always come from a place of calculated malice and mean you don't care.\n\nI forgive and forgive and forgive and I've bore so fucking much lasting damage that my brain finally just snapped and broke and then I fuck up and everything is ruined.  It doesn't seem fair.  It doesn't seem right.  And I know that me forgiving someone doesn't mean they have to forgive me in return but I just...I don't understand.  I don't know how someone can go from saying I'm wonderful to saying I'm a bad person in a span of days.  It doesn't make sense and it has completely fucked with everything I thought I knew about everyone and every relationship I have.  I'm so scared and I feel like I can't trust a single person or anything they say anymore.\n\nAll I fucking wanted was friendship and company and I tried so hard and now I don't even know what's real anymore and I'm being told I'm a bad person...I've been crying and crying and crying so fucking hard for days on end, since I got home.  I keep having panic attack after panic attack and freaking out thinking I'm having a heart attack.  I can't handle this, I can't function.  I just want it to stop.  I just want it all to fucking stop.    I'm so fucking tired of feeling alone and worthless and useless and fragile and unlovable and broken.  I can't fucking take it anymore and I just need to make it stop.\n\nI've had fights with people, including very close friends, before and it has never, EVER affected me like this.  I feel like my entire brain and sense of self and everything I thought I knew about every relationship I've ever had has been absolutely shattered and I don't know what to do.  I tried to talk and make it right and I get pushed away.  I just don't know what to do.\n\nI was going to post this under a throwaway because some people know my Reddit account and I'm honestly scared I'm even going to be accused of attention seeking or trying to guilt them or something by posting about it but I can't even be bothered to, I'm so mentally and physically exhausted, my brain feels absolutely broken and I don't have the energy or will to do much of anything.  They already think I'm a bad person, who fucking cares.  I'm terrible.  I'm so sorry.\n\nUpdate a few hours later:  thanks for the kind words everyone, they mean a lot to me but i really really can't do this right now.  i made everything worse and really ruined everything and i'm nothing but a huge joke to people i love and care about.  i'm weak and I'm stupid and i forget things and words come out wrong and I hurt people and I can never ever forgive myself.  I made an utter fool of myself in front of everyone and said horrible horrible things and I accidentally blabbed about something someone's extremely insecure about because I'm so stupid and forgetful and my brain is so foggy I straight up fucking forgot (not that they'd ever believe me regarding that).  I never once judged anyone and I always cared and loved everyone with all my heart, I'm just too much of a goddamn stupid broken mess to go about anything properly.  I hate myself, I hate my brain for betraying me and confusing me and upsetting me and making me act in ways I don't want to or mean to.  I take full responsibility because it's not an excuse but I hate it I HATE IT, I HATE that I hurt people and I really am a bad person and i'm so so sorry.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "In what circumstances did the narrator lose their temper and say hurtful things to someone they were close to?\nHow do other people react to the narrator's outburst and subsequent behavior?\nIs there a chance the relationship can be repaired or is it too late?\nWhat made the person finally snap and how does this affect them mentally/emotionally?\nHow are they coping with their anxiety/depression when they forget to take medication?"}
{"prompt": "I have sexual thoughts about kids. I'm 26. Please don't hate me, I already hate myself more than you ever will.\nI wasn't always this way.

I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.\n\nBelieve me: you cannot hate me more than I hate myself.

{"prompt": "[Serious] Do I have to love my difficult, self-centered and narcissistic father?\nHey guys! Ever since I could remember my father and I have had a pretty strained relationship. Growing up my father had a very hard time expressing his emotions. For most of my childhood he was always at work and was always thinking about money. I vividly remember being really young, maybe six years old, and him showing me his bills and how much he had to pay. He would explain how much he is doing for me and that I should be thankful for his sacrifices. My whole childhood was spent discussing money, bills and my father's stress about making money and paying the bills. **I felt like his therapist instead of his daughter.** He only seemed to talk to me when he WANTED to rather than being there for me because he was my father. He never really took the time to get to know me, however, he didn't have any problems trying to exercise his control over me. He knew how to push my buttons with guilt, always trying to make me feel like his behavior was MY fault. He was very verbally abusive and didn't hesitate to curse or put me down. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to earn his love through awards, a nearly perfect GPA and a full four-year merit scholarship to college. Little did I know chasing after those things would never make him change. My dad is 62 years old now, and he still hasn't changed. Sure he doesn't yell as much anymore, but he's still the same guy. The only reason he's changed is for HIS own health because HE doesn't want to take in stress although he didn't mind making me and my mother stressed for the past 18 years. I'm at a stage in my life where I no longer felt empathy towards him. I don't know if I should love him. **How can I love my father if I don't like his personality? I really need help because these experiences still cut deep and hurt.** \n\nJust to sum up some of my traumatic experiences/memories associated with my father:\n\n1. My dad talking non-stop about his stress and piling his emotional pain onto me . His favorite sentence is \"I'm sick\" (even though he isn't sick) and \"My head hurts\". He doesn't know how to have a conversation that doesn't involve HIM. It is always about him, his life and his problems. \n2. He only talked about money and bills. He always painted money in a negative light, and constantly reminded me of how sad and stressed he was about paying our bills. As a result, he made me feel like a burden on him. \n3. He likes drinking and socializing more than being a father. The only time I've seen my father really happy is when he drinking or with friends. He may stress about money but does not hesitate to buy a big bottle of alcohol for him and his friends. He drinks almost every night and self medicates his pain with alcohol. \n4. He use to be aggressive when I was a child. He would swerve the car if he got mad and his yell was very very very loud. He would basically scream in our faces and threaten to hit us if we challenged him or his authority. \n5. I saw him treat my mother like shit. He never once respected my mother or the work that she does to provide for me and my family. I watched him yell at her and curse at her. The first traumatic memory I have had of my father is him yelling and screaming and cursing at my mother to the point she left our apartment and ran out the door.

But not earning money makes me a burden and puts me into a depression because I'm burdening everyone around me and I am only alive for three reasons.\n\n1- I am terrified of death.\n\n2- The people who care about me don't want me to die.\n\n3- I am greedy and have things I want to see or experience.\n\nI don't have any hope that I will ever be able to live a normal life. I don't think I will ever have a job that doesn't take over my entire existence and cause me to be depressed. But I also know I will continue to be depressed because I'm actively harming the people who care about me.\n\nI want to help people. I want to create things that make others lives worth living. But I know, statistically, I won't ever be able to obtain a living doing anything remotely like that and even if I did, it would drain me into depression regardless.\n\nI wish I believed anything could change. But I stopped believing in that years ago. Every time I leave the house or even Skype call a friend... After its over I just have this instinctual gut feeling of, \"thank the universe that is over. I never want to do that again.\" But I always do. Because everyone says I need to leave the house and have friends. But how many times do I have to slam my face into the brick wall before others will acknowledge the brick wall exists for me and they just can't see it?\n\nBut then there ARE some rare times where I enjoy things. \n\nBut it's like fucking gambling. I've lived for 25 solid years and I can think of all the times I've been happy with my life... And it adds up to maybe 2 to 3 years of it. \n\nWhat if I live another 25 and that number stays consistent? Is 50 years worth living if I can only look back on 5-6 years of that and say I was happy? \n\nI feel like I should quit now while the ratio is slightly more likely to be less dismal. I'm terrified that is only going to get worse. I'm going to live till I'm 100 somehow and the number of years worth living for will still be only 8 or so.\n\nI don't know what to do.

Well she mentioned it last night and I told her straight up that I was just getting over the old girl but we were not together while I was texting her(which was mostly true).

{"prompt": "I miss my old college crush. I still have feelings for her, and just can't quit thinking about her.\nOver 2 years ago. When I was in college, I met a girl I had a real connection to. Cute as a button, I honestly think she may have been \"the one\" but I never took the initiative. I liked her. A lot. After 2 years, we've gone our separate ways. We haven't talked at all, but I still have feelings for her. Strong feelings. I have always regretted it.\n\nI actually thought i loved her. I might still, i know i still have dreams about her.\n\nActually, if I tell about how we met and everything, tell me, do you think I would've had a shot?\n\nHere's how we met. It was my first year of college, there was another couple group of friends i used to hang out with in high school. They were sitting in the lobby, talking. So i joined them. She was with them. One of our friends introduced us, and said she was new in town and didn't have many friends here. We talked a bit and the next day, i saw her again, so i went up and said hello. We talked for a bit, and every day after that we would talk to each other, sometimes up to a half hour.\n\nWe were very similar. Seriously, like scary similar. It really felt like i met, like, a duplicate of myself. Except, you know, female. We were similar in a lot of ways, similar values, hobbies and even similar personalities. Plus, neither of us drove. We both got picked up by somebody. We also hate tomato, yet love ketchup and spaghetti sauce and pizza. The only difference I ever really between us was that I like anime and she doesn\u2019t. The biggest part for me, however. Was politics. You see, i am a conservative. That's just how i've always been. Now, i've always heard about how left leaning college campuses are. I never honestly expected to run into another conservative. especially one so incredibly vocal and active about their beliefs.\n\nI started to like her, she might have felt the same for me, i don't know for sure though. I saw a few signs, nothing certain, but still. I know she always laughed at my sense of humor. I have a very weird sense of humor, i think it's called dry humor, but i make a little \"quip\" about almost everything, and most people think it's bizarre or stupid. It's gotten me a lot of weird looks, but not her, she always bursted out laughing whenever i would. I've never really was able to make anyone laugh like that. And some of the things i said were really stupid. Our first meeting, we only learned each other's first names. The next time we met, i learned her last name. Her last name is also that of a celebrity and i just said \"Any relation to (that celebrity)\". Laughed like crazy, she asked me for mine, i told her mine, she said something about it, like what country of origin it is because i have a fairly unique last name, it's german, then i just said \"Hey, maybe next time, we can learn each others middle names\" more laughing. My celebrity impressions also got a kick out of her. Then there was the time a celebrity died, she was on her phone and said something about it, and I just remarked \u201cwell, looks like Hillary just got another vote\u201d. But, i think most i've ever made her laugh was a joke i made. It was something about Hillary Clinton and having something fall on her. I just said \"If that happened, i wonder if her feet would curl up and slink back under it.\"\n\nYes, my quips were stupid, but they got a laugh out of her. Every time. Everyone else gets weirded out and annoyed by my humor, but not her. They always got a laugh out of her. And I enjoyed making her laugh, she always had this cute laugh, which she\u2019d snort. That\u2019s the only sign I ever got from her, well that and she always tried to high five me and shake my hand if that means anything\n\nAnyway, we were also both somewhat shy people, so i never made a move, she didn't either. And for 2-3 days a week for almost a year, we talked every time we saw each other, not just saying hi as we passed each other, but we would sit in the lobby together after class, talking as we waited for our rides to come to pick us up, which sometimes took up to a half hour. Every day, she'd talk to me, just me until her sister picked her up. About life, some favorite interests we had in common. It was really nice and I actually looked forward to it. Then there was the last day before Christmas vacation, I sat at a table, we sat at the same table and talked for almost an hour before her family came and got her. Exclusively me. She didn\u2019t glance at her phone, except to call her family that class was over (we had our final exam that day), but it took only about 20-30 minutes and class was generally 3 hours).\n\nWe had the same math class my first semester, but the second, however, we didn\u2019t. Our paths just crossed because we had the same schedule. I mean, I had a girl, with whom, I had a solid connection with and saw every day. But I never did anything about it. My first semester, I didn\u2019t know her as well as I did the day before Christmas Break. I thought that would be it, but the next year we had a similar schedule again. I still didn\u2019t do it. I wanted to, but I just couldn\u2019t formulate the words to do it. I\u2019d always freeze up before I could do it. I just kept telling myself \u201cnext week, I\u2019ll surely do it next week\u201d but weeks turned to months and before I knew it, the semester was over. She was gone the next year. She transferred to a university (it was a community college). And my chances were lost forever. I never saw her again.\n\nShe was smart, she was cute, she\u2019s one of the few people I\u2019ve met who actually really liked my sense of humor, she always wanted to talk to me and even approached me on her own, she seemed interested in me and I just let her get away.\n\ni kind of miss her, and still, honestly, have some feelings for her. I am friends with her on Facebook, but have never messaged her. I mean, over 2 years has passed since that time. Since we\u2019ve talked or communicated whatsoever. I really miss her, and letting her slip by it definitely one of my biggest regrets. In the time, she's graduated, but she hasn't posted anything about a boyfriend, getting married, or anything. She posted about how fun her summer was, but everything she posted was with her sister. I still have some slight hope that maybe I still have a shot at rectifying things, but she probably doesn\u2019t remember me anyway. I haven\u2019t even bothered trying.\n\nOh well.

But what if I truly don\u2019t have one thing in life that I see myself doing for the rest of my life? \n\nI just graduated and while I have little hobbies of yoga, hanging with my dog and friends, shopping,  and smoking weed-I don\u2019t know if any of that defines me. They\u2019re also pretty basic and generic to try and mold your life around. I mean I know yoga can be a big part of life, but I think for me it\u2019s just a way to relieve stress and pain. I think my lack of passion is proved by the fact that I have absolutely nothing enjoyable to do with all this free unemployed time while away from friends. I hate it. \n\nMy one and only dream has been to have my own beautifully decorated studio apartment in the city with my dog. And one day far away, a mom. I literally just want to be independent. It\u2019s hard to get there without any understanding of who you want to be. Maybe it\u2019s because I have depression, but I\u2019m not actually sad right now, just lost.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for these responses. I\u2019ve been trying to take pauses in between my day and read them all.

I just want to figure out what I can literally just TOLERATE. I KNOW I find passion in anything I feel adequate in, that will reward in itself.

{"prompt": "Is it okay to give up on my dreams......?\nAnd do something just for the money? Saw a career counselor at a local community college yesterday.

{"prompt": "24 with no work experience and completely lost in life. What should I do?\n Hello all, I know this probably gets asked a lot but I felt like I really needed to get some advice. Lately I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks at night while I think about the future. I graduated from university exactly 2 years ago, and I have been unemployed and lost ever since. In college I was initially a business major with plans to specialize in sports business (sports are by far my biggest passion). After taking and struggling with the required classes such as Accounting, I did not meet the requirements to make it into the business school. With my business degree chances evaporated I changed majors and graduated with a more generic economics/business/sociology type degree with a minor in media studies.\n\nAs graduation approached I still had no answer to the classic question of \u201cso what are you going to do next?\u201d. I still love sports business but that field seems incredibly cutthroat and unstable. As an introverted guy I would really not fit in with that style of super social and outgoing personality to have success in that field. At this point in my life I feel just completely overwhelmed. The thought of a 9-5 job that I don\u2019t enjoy makes me sick to my stomach just imagining it. My resume is barren and the more time that goes by the worse it will be. I have been studying for an IT certification but have made little progress. It makes me incredibly disappointed in myself that I can\u2019t even get myself to study anymore. After 2 years of doing nothing I feel like I have snuffed out any flame of ambition I once had. I dread holidays and get anxious thinking about how I\u2019m going to answer when family and strangers ask me \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d.\n\nI know this is more of a rant but I felt like I needed to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone here has battled through a similar period in their life.\n\nMy main passions are sports, film, animals/environmental justice, poker (I love game theory and statistics).\n\nThank you!\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your advice and wisdom. I kinda just expected to get a couple comments. I will read through all of your comments and I am trying to respond to all of you. If I don\u2019t reply, don\u2019t take it that I don\u2019t appreciate your comment.

{"prompt": "How do I say \"I want a chill job\" without using those words?\nDue to health reasons and a desire to survive while I transition to a  more creative career in music and writing, I want to take an easier day job. I work in marketing and it's pretty brutal. The work itself is not difficult, but I've yet to meet a CEO or director who isn't flying by the seat of their pants, that actually has a mission, yearly goals, and vision of what things we do and, more importantly, what we *don't*  do.

{"prompt": "I NEED GUY ADVICE!!!\nI need advice on guys. Recently I went to Canada to go and visit family friends with my mom and my brother. There are three guys and they have always acted like cousins to us. One guy who is 19 has always been close to me I\u2019m 15. During winter break me and him were watching Netflix in a twin bed and he put his arm around me. After he put his arm around me and my mom walked into the room and yelled at us on how this is not lady like on my behalf. She left the room and later I pause the movie because of the awkward tension between us. My mom pulled him aside without me knowing and asked him if he liked me. He said he didn\u2019t know his feelings towards me in that way. The next day at night he asked my brother if he wanted to watch TV. My brother said no because he was tired so when the 19-year-old walked past me I suggested we could watch Netflix. Earlier that day it was his birthday and he got a new phone. So I said I could help him set it up before we watch Netflix. I sat on his bed waiting for him to get changed into comfy clothes in the bathroom. After a while everyone in the house fell sleep and I asked him if we were still going to watch Netflix. He said yes and put on a new movie for us to watch. We watched the hunger games. His arm was uncomfortable so I suggested he put his arm around me. He sat there for a while and I told him I wanted snacks. I told him to come with me because I had to walk all the way downstairs and it was dark. After we got snacks we went upstairs and he sat on the inside of the bed closest to the wall and he got mad because he\u2019s bigger than me. I told him that I should lay on the outside because I was gonna go to bed soon. When he went to lay on the inside of the bed he put his arm on the pillow. So when I would lay down his arm would be behind me. He put his arm around me without asking me. After 10 minutes he slid his arm down my waist and kept it there. I put my head on his chest and we watched the movie for an hour. I got tired and suggested that I should go to bed. He told me that I should stay longer because we were both comfortable. I told him I had to go to bed because I was tired and we were gonna wake up early the next day to hang out with family. When I went back to my room I did not know what just happened. The next night he asked me if I wanted to watch Netflix. At this point I do not know if he likes me or not because I didn\u2019t think anyone would act this way towards someone they don\u2019t like. He had his arm around my waist. We were comfortable with each other. Expected that I was most likely going to go to bed and he wouldn\u2019t argue for me to stay longer. I went to bed at 3 AM and we both had to wake up at 8 AM to go skiing. While we were skiing I fell down and he picked me up. To make sure I wouldn\u2019t fall down again he put his arm around my waist. He asked me if I wanted to do it an all nighter. He later fell asleep because he was tired from skiing all day. I woke him up and asked if he still wanted to watch Netflix and he said yes. He later fell asleep. The next day I told him why didn\u2019t he stay awake so we can watch Netflix because it was my last night there. He said I was supposed to wake him up again and got mad at me. The day we went skiing was my last day in Canada and I was leaving the next day so it was our last chance to cuddle and watch Netflix.

Since I graduated five years ago my life has been very rocky and my work history is a mess, with several extended gaps. After moving to California I ended up getting a clerical job related to my degree. I worked there a year and a half but then had a mental breakdown. I moved across the country (to Texas) and spent a year unemployed. I met someone and signed a lease with them. That lease ends in three weeks and my life has fallen apart.

{"prompt": "Working 2 full time jobs. How to avoid burnout?\nLong story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I\u2019m learning how to manage money better but I\u2019m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home.

I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I\u2019ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I\u2019ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up.

I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I\u2019d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably.

I started as an Office Assistant but took on more duties that involved help in the administrative team. My duties evolved to the point that they decided to create a new title for me: Operations Specialist. This involves, IT support, systems management, Contact Resource Management, training new-hires, new hire paperwork, creating flyers and promotional materials for events, direct supervision of office assistant, compiling and reporting on data to our funders and contractors etc.\n\nToday:\n\nI was told this morning that they are going to move our current Office Manager to a different position and have me absorb her duties and her title.

I was told that I am already in the middle range of the new position so she wouldn't consider a pay raise discussion until 3 months. I asked if she would be flexible on that at all and was told that it's not in the budget at the moment and, because I will have to learn quickbooks, I don't have all of the job skills required yet anyway.\n\nI asked what would happen if I decide the new position is not for me. I was told \" If you decided that it wasn't for you then I guess you are resigning.\u00a0 We don't have any other positions open. \"\n\nI have two questions: Can I get unemployment if I don't want the job? Have they done something wrong to me? I can't really figure it out.

Not smiling** :  \n\nIf you see a woman scowling, does it make you want to approach her? Probably not, as you already get the idea that she\u2019s in a bad mood. \n\n**2.

Closed body language:** \n\nThe more closed off your body language, the more unapproachable you seem. It might be crossing your arms or legs. Or keeping your hands in your pockets.\n\n**4. Not having fun:** \n\nThis one is mainly relevant if you\u2019re in a social environment e.g. a bar or a party.\u00a0We\u2019ll naturally gravitate to the men who are clearly having the most fun. Why?\n\n**5. Looking busy:**\n\nWe\u2019re socially conditioned to not want to interrupt people who are busy.\u00a0But most of us these days are doing things to keep from being bored \u2014 which also makes us look unapproachable.  \n\n\nThanks.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the \"simple truth\" about people who are not \"projecting an air of approachability?\"\nWhat are the five biggest reasons why \"most women view a majority of men as being absolutely unapproachable?\"\nWhat are the five main contributing factors that make someone appear unapproachable?\nWhy are women unapproachable?\nWhat are the five biggest reasons why?\nWhat does eye contact mean?\nWhat does closed body language mean?\nCan being unapproachable hurt you with women?"}

{"prompt": "Dating virgin\nSo...4 recent dates. 2 were duds, 1 was effortlessly fun and sparky, and the latest 1 was nice. \n\nEffotlessly fun one- chatted on Bumble for a few weeks. A+ banter, personality and cute messages. Met IRL and we seemed to click right away, didn't feel awkward AT ALL, had a good time. There was chemistry and I knew I liked him because I wanted to TOUCH him. Nice eyes, hands (good sign!), thighs. After the date, he asked in one of his last messages if I wanted to see him naked. I replied saying I like things a little slower, but had a great time. Messaged died out. Really liked him, and imagined us having sex, but needed a bit more than 2 hours. Not a bad guy, but looking back, can see he doesn't have the emotional availably for a relationship right now.\n\nLatest guy, exchanged 20 messages in 2 days and met up for a drink. He was nice, but so chatty that I didn't have a chance to ask him many questions and it didn't allow for banter, it was conversation heavy. He said I was very quiet, but nice. He asked if I'd want to meet up again and my intentions. I said a boyfriend, and he was sussing out if I'd be interested in something causal.\n\nYes, I want love and a relationship, but I'm also ready for sex - emotionally, physically, mentally. But I need a bit of emotional connection so I feel safe and can enjoy my first time. Like, maybe I don't even need the first guy to be my boyfriend, but I'm not ready for sex after 1 date. If I like them, should I be saying I'd be okay with something casual if I got to know them a bit? That probably doesn't sound very casual.\n\nCatch 22 - you want to be fun and flirty on dates so you can see if you have chemistry and click - but this leads people to ASSUME experience because most 23 y/o have had sex. But if I hold back, not super flirty, they seem to think I'm too quiet/disinterested. But hey, he assumed experience anyway. I'm just trying to be careful, have fun. I'm not TRYING to lead people on. \n\nCasual sex seems to be popular and that's COOL, but this virgin needs a minute.

{"prompt": "I'm absolutely gutted, from 100 to 0 in a instant.\nSo, I really haven't been that interested in dating anyone for a very long time, for at least 5 years. Sure I've met people that I liked but never really clicked, or they have other issues which stop me from wanting to be with them. I haven't really been looking... But I haven't been turning people away either.\n\n4 months ago, I met someone who I thought was freaking amazing.  Very pretty, smart, funny, similar personalities, similar interests. She was absolutely stunning. She wasn't perfect, but initially we got on like a house on fire. Honestly It's been so long since I've felt a genuine connection with a female. I'm typically pretty awkward, but things just seemed really natural and easy going between us. We seemed extremely well matched.Issue was, that this was a camping trip and she had come from another part of the country. So we only saw each other for a few days before separating. For the last four months, we have been talking every day, and calling weekly. Things seemed really healthy, and I was becoming optimistic that I had finally found someone.\n\nBut things between us slowed down in the last few weeks. Largely because of me having a rough time with life in general.\n\n* My sister tried to commit suicide, I saved her life after she overdosed.\n* My dad has been extremely low with depression.\n* My friendships have been suffering, due to me finding out about one of my good mates cheating in his relationship.\n* My granddad is very ill, and likely wont leave hospital again.\n* One of my mates died in a car crash.\n* I lost my job (redundancy). And have been struggling financially.\n* I failed study because of the above.\n* I have felt really low, and depressed. Feeling like I don't have much support.\n\nI let her know what was happening, and she didn't seem that worried at all. Although I wasn't reaching out to her as much as normal during this time, she would always respond straight away. She said she understood, and was really caring and supporting of the situation. So I planned a trip to go visit her and my brother, after things settled down. At this point we were not in a relationship, but were still really close. My plan was to see how things went, and perhaps consider asking her out if things went well (I knew for sure she liked me).Keeping in mind, I have family where she lives, and was graduating soon. The job market in her part of the country is ideal for what I'm studying... So moving to be closer to her and my family was defiantly an option. Any relationship with her wont have been long distance for long at all.\n\nI booked flights, and she was really excited. All systems were go.... Until today. She messaged me, saying that she probably couldn't make it to our date, since she had to work instead.... I was really confused, since we had been talking about this for awhile, and she had told me she had taken the time off work.I then saw something on one of her mates snap chat, which to me looked like she was with someone else at a party.So I asked her whether she was seeing someone else. Her response, \"Yea, sort of... We have been staying at each others house, and seeing a lot of each other. But we are not really dating\". She then goes on to say how he is her ex, and they were together for 3 years a couple of years ago, and how they have caught up, and things are starting to pick up again.\n\nI then asked weather I could have done anything differently, and weather things would have worked out if we were in the same city. Her response was that yes, she probably would have dated me if we were in the same city, and that she did like me.\n\nSo well, fuck. There's my weekend plans ruined. At least I have family up there, so my plans now are just to catch up with my brother, and help him work on his project car.Just feels like a really shitty ending, to a really shitty point in my life... So I've got a plane to catch in a couple of days, to go spend some time with my brother. Which is fine.... I was just really looking forward to seeing this girl. It's been so long since I've actually developed feelings for someone, and now I'm crushed.  \n\n\nEdit: Grammar.   \n\n\nHoly shit. Wasn't expecting such a large response everyone.

{"prompt": "reconnected with a girl i met 4+ years ago\nIt all started in 2015 when i (m25 then, 29 now) first met her (w21 then, 25 now)  via mutual friends. We both were single at the time. She never had a bf before and zero experience at all, on the other side i already had 2 pretty shitty short term flicks. We started to hang out more often and eventually i had a feeling that this could work out, so i did send that risky text, asking her about what she feels. I'm a pretty shy and introverted person so this was anything but easy for me and the reason i did it via text and not in person. She turned me down, not because she didn't like me but because she  felt more like being just friends would feel better to her. Back then i thought \"fuck yeah, i got friendzoned\" and sadly did not invest that much effort into the friendship anymore. I always told myself it was to get over my feeling to her, but in the end it was kind of a dick and selfish move.\n\nSome months passed and i eventually met my now ex gf of the next 4 years. In all that time i maybe had a handful conversations with her, mainly on birthdays and new years etc. It still felt like there was some kind of connection even when we havent seen in all those years and barely talked. I actually was interrested in keeping closer contact and build up on that friendship now that i'm not single anymore and feelings probably couldn't hurt me. But my gf at the time was a really jealous person and did not want me to have contact or a friendship with a girl i used to have feelings for. So we never met in those 4 years, when it actually could have been so easy since she studied in the same town as i was living in for the past 2 years.\n\n2020 rolls in, i'm a fresh single again and actually pretty happy with that. At first i didn't thought about her but she recently started being quite active on social media (she is a cosplayer) and it got my attention. I asked her to met up and she was in for it without any hesitation. It took us almost 2 months to finally set up a day but in the end we got there. Since then we have met more than once, just the two of us and sometimes with mutual friends and this past weekend she slept at my place because we were out with friends and she couldn't catch her train in time. \"Nothing\" happend, we just talked for hours straight (you know that drunken trashtalk you do) until it was already early in the morning and we totally messed up out sleepcycle by only getting 2 hours of sleep in the end.\n\nI had to get up at noon for a football (soccer) game and told her she could stay in my appartment as long as she wants to. As soon as i left for my game i felt like i probably missed a chance there and couldn't help it but text her about how good it felt to reconnect with her and that i haven't been that happy in a long time. I once again send that risky text asking her about what she feels and if she still thinks of me as \"just a friend\". Even if she did, i would have been fine with it now, i learned so much in these years that i wouldn't have called it \"friendzoned again\". To my surprise she answered almost instantly and hell this fact and the actual response cheered me up like nothing did in a very long time.\n\nShe is in for the \"let's see where this is going and if it works out, why not\". Later we talked about the sleepover and what would have happend if i made a move that night. She said she probably would have gone with it, but she is very happy i didn't since we both were still a bit drunk and that i showed a lot of respect for her to not take advantage of that. She thinks it was way better to talk about it before and if i haven't send that risky text, she would have done it later that day.\n\nNow here i am, looking forward to dating a wonderful woman and so excited for what is about to happen in the next days, weeks, months or even years. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my story and have a nice day everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsmall update: We met again and watched princess mononoke at her place (we both love this anime) and after the movie talked again for hours. I had to leave at midnight because i start working at 6am.

On mobile.\n\nI've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.\n\nThis guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.\nThings weren't always perfect.\n\nI nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.\nThis year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse.\n\nI tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him.\nOn the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well.\nThen on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky.\nHe said he didn't love me anymore.\nHe finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didn't realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didn't know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.\nHe then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. \nIn that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? It wasn't logical.\nWe argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.\nFine.\n\nI let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.\nWe didn't end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday.\nWe talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant.\n\nBefore I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.\nFast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together.\nWe went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination.  While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.\nAfter our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together.\n\nThe day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.\nWe ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out.\n\nDuring this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasn't someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasn't buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb.\nI didn't want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long I've known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasn't lying and that I wasn't just anyone.\n\nAs soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.\nI ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since August.\n\nHe wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.\nHe decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. It didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.\nOnce we got closer I confronted him. I couldn't keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked.\nHe said he hadn't loved me for a while.\nThat when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.\nThrough all this I couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.\nWe argued the rest of the way home.\nAt the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.\nI ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.\n\nSince I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.\n\nAnd so now I'm just here.

To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  \n\nAs someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.

Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  \n\nIn contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.

{"prompt": "How to gain back confidence after being fired twice in a row?\nSo this whole situation started late 2018 when i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, after i was given an offer for a really good opportunity to work at an highly respected company to start Jan 2019.\n\nWhen i started the job i disclosed my mental illness at the time as this company gave the impression that they care about their employees mental health, and that they had a number of mental health ambassadors around so if someone needed to talk they could have a chat with one of them. This obviously appealed to me at the time as i felt as though i could be open... boy was i completed wrong.\n\nThings started to hit the fan only a few days into this job where my manager caught me crying outside the office, and she told me that i was not capable of this position and that they needed someone strong to be in this position and it was a highly pressured role dealing with various reports and having meetings with senior managers and directors. Now her response did take me back, so i plead with her to give me a chance and that i can make this work.\n\nNow to cut a long story short here my manager was micromanaging me as this was her first time being a manager so i figured she didn\u2019t know how to manager due to being inexperienced. So i carried on doing what I\u2019m doing and then she started becoming hostile and shouting at me for things like spelling issues, fonts not right and not cleaning the email mailbox. \nNow to be honest my mental health through this got worst as i was making mistakes but i felt i could not concentrate as my manager was always on my back making me feel more nervous, and at times every task i would do i felt i would have to run it past her just to see if i was doing the work to her standard. But all this came to backfire on me as i was fired at the end of my probation and one of the major feedback points were that i did not take initiative and that i felt everything i do had to be audited\n\nThe second job i started this year in January and from the start i noticed that manager that was trying to train me wasn\u2019t clear in her expectations of what i was supposed to be doing in the role and i found my self having to ask her over and over what i needed to be doing. Once i started getting an hang on what i was supposed to be doing she would say things like \u2018 i didn\u2019t say, if you remember i said\u2019 but the thing is i was documenting everything she said and i even told her this but she claimed she could not recall her saying anything i told her she said. So during my time at this job i noticing more and more that my manager backtracks on everything that she says, its almost like she has amnesia and also she would say small things that would offend me like \u2018I\u2019m not a senior as I\u2019m not doing senior work\u2019 but when i would ask her for specifics she was say \u2018well your a senior you should already know, and its not my job to tell you your job\u2019 so after this i reported her to her manager as at the time i didn\u2019t want to speak to HR yet and her manager advised me that he will go to HR on my behalf and obviously that backfired and i was let go about 3 weeks after that \n\nNow prior to these two jobs i had a really good career and done my job at an excellent level according to previous employers and coworkers. But I\u2019m not gunna lie these last two jobs really took a hit at my confidence and it had make me question my competency in my career.

{"prompt": "Is it worthwhile to question job recruiters about potential wage increases?\nA few months ago I got my first job in the networking field (computer sciences).  I went to school for this, and a week after my final day of class, I started this job, I was hired before I even graduated.  It seemed too good to be true.  A lot of people graduate and are stuck looking for work in their field, I suppose I got lucky enough to have found that quite quickly.  I am thankful for this, and it is experience in the IT field at the very least.\n\nThe job I am working only hires people through job recruiters, you can't be directly hired into these positions.  There are multiple recruiting agencies that look for candidates for these jobs, and the one I use is rumored to be one of the better ones (according to coworkers).  Until today, I had never spoken to anyone about their wages, but I have heard multiple other coworkers complain about how low the wages are for this field in comparison to other companies.  I admittedly thought it was low before I was hired, but for entry level, I wasn't going to complain.\n\nWell two of my former classmates were hired to this company, both obtaining the same degree as myself.  However, neither of these two people have any certifications in the IT world, whereas I obtained my CCENT and my CCNA (Cisco certifications.  This is important as we are contractual workers for Cisco), neither of them have experience in the field either.  It comes to find out, they both get paid more than me.  One by a rather insignificant amount, the other by +$4 per hour.  This seems off to me, I studied and paid to obtain certifications whereas the other two have either failed their cert exams, or have yet to attempt them.\n\nWhen I first applied to this job, all I had was my CCENT.  I was told what my wage would be, and I agreed to it.  Right before being officially hired, I took my ICND2 exam and passed earning me my CCNA.  I figured this might raise my salary slightly, but it didn't.  I was also told that this job only hired those with their CCENT or CCNA certs, but preferred CCNA.  Now I am realizing that that isn't true at all, considering the two people I mentioned obtaining the same position. \n\nMy question is, are job recruiters generally open to the idea of potential wage increases or am I just SOL?  I agreed to the wage offered, and I can't be mad if I am stuck with it.  From what I have gathered from other coworkers (many of which go through the same recruiter as myself), you are kind of stuck with what you get with zero room for advancement.  But what strikes me as interesting is my pay being less, even though, \"technically\", I should be more qualified.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Are employers generally open to the idea of a potential wage increase?\nHow does taking an exam and passing raise your salary?\nWhat is the difference between a contract worker and an employee?\nAre benefits offered to contract workers?"}

During this time, my committee/co-authors and I have been working on my manuscript via email. During my time as a grad student I never had any issues with my committee members or any of their edits except for one. One member refused to help most of the time, because he saw it as doing it for me. I get where he was coming from so I just taught myself instead of going to him with any questions. And before you ask, no I could not have replaced him on the committee unfortunately.\n\nNow, out of the blue, he\u2019s asked me for all of my data, and all of my Rstudio code under the pretense that he wanted it for another student who is working on a similar project. So I sent him most everything. However, I had a feeling he really just wanted to rerun all stats and analyses.

Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. \n\nBut as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? \n\nMaking matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. \n\nSo as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.\n\nIt seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. \n\nI know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -\n\n1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? \n\n2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? \n\nIs there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here?

It is then stepped down using a transformer, and then again rectified.For a non-isolated SMPS supply, I think we either first rectify it and then pass it through the switching regulator, or we first pass the input ac voltage through a switching regulator to get the desired voltage, and then rectify it to get a dc voltage.I would also appreciate if anyone can please share a block diagram of a non isolated SMPS.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is it better to rectify and convert input voltage before or after passing it through a switching regulator?\nIs an AC voltage safe for use with a switching regulator?\nWhere should the conversion from AC to DC take place, at the input or at the output?\nWhat are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a non-isolated SMPS supply?"}

{"prompt": "Indirect complement or postmodifier in NP In the sentence[1] He is the most talented artist (that) I knowwhat is (that) I know in terms of function \\u2013 an indirect complement, licensed by most, or simply a common postmodifier? Why?Similarly, what is in the world in[2] the most talented artist in the worldand why?Addition to the original post:Having read the answer and the comments that I've received for this question, along with answers to other questions about licensing and the modifier/complement distinction, I have to give this another go: According to the comments below, we are dealing with modifiers rather than (indirect) complements in both the above examples. I'm not doubting the validity of these comments \\u2013 I just still don't understand. This is why:   As far as I've been able to understand, licensing is all about setting up \\\"slots\\\" for specific kinds of structure. For instance, a verb such as give sets up a slot for something being given, and a slot for a recipient; consequently it licenses two object complements (direct and indirect object). Part of the deal is also that the slots set up are specific to a subset of \\\"licensers\\\"; in this case: not all verbs license two objects.Now, to me it seems that this 'setting up slots that are specific to a certain subgroup' is exactly what superlatives do, something that, I think, is supported by John Lawler's answer below:<blockquote>  Most is a superlative marker and takes a superlative construction. One of the things required for the construction is a range for comparison </blockquote>Looking again at [1] and [2], it seems to me that both the relative clause in [1] and the PP in [2] elaborate on the \\\"range-for-comparison-slot\\\" set up by most; hence, they should both be licensed by most, no?Now, if these dependents are indeed licensed, they should be complements \\u2013 shouldn't they? Only, since they aren't licensed by the head noun, but rather by another constituent within the NP, they'd be indirect complements. This is my take on all this \\u2013 could someone please explain to me where I go wrong, and how I should think instead?Thank you\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the functions of the relative clause in [1] and the PP in [2]?\nWhat is the range for comparison set up by most?\nWhat does it mean that they are indirect complements, rather than direct complements?\nWhy can't we say that these dependents are licensed by the head noun?"}

{"prompt": "Are particles and waves separate entities? Can this be proven incorrect: Particles and waves are separate entities. Waves are the energy mechanism that transports the particle but not part of the particle itself. If a photon gets created the electron that created it drops to a lower energy level, providing the energy wave around the photon to travel in a certain direction.

A surfer rides a wave but behaves like a \\\"particle\\\" and as (part of) a wave - moving up an down and along the wave he is riding. But the surfer is not a body/particle and a wave although he acts like a particle and a wave. Therefor with the double slit experiment the wave travels through both slits, but the particle only through one and is affected by the interference pattern on the other side of the slits.

{"prompt": "Are eigenstates of the position operator continuous? The way I've understood it is that eigenfunction of an operator are the different states which the actual wavefunction can take when the property/observable corresponding to the given operator is being observed. For the Hamiltonian operator, the eigenfunctions are forms the wavefunction will take when energy is being measured. The probability that we get a specific state corresponds to the coefficient from fourier decomposition of the wavefunction. I've also read/interpreted/misinterpreted that upon measurement of position, a wavefunction will collapse to a single spike with a specific value of position (determinate state of the position observable).With all of the above in mind, is it correct to think that the eigenstates of the position operator are continuous, because the probability density function is continuous and we can get a spike anywhere?Also, does this mean that the wavefunction takes the form of a spike when position is being observed, but a sine wave when the energy is being observed?Edit: by continuous eigenstates I want to say that there is an infinite number of them.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How are eigenstates of the position operator different from other operators?\nWhat is a sine wave?\nAre eigenstates of the position operator continuous?\nWhat is the difference between a continuous and discrete state?"}

{"prompt": "Would spinning salt emit radiation? It wouldn't need to be salt. Basically I was initially thinking about a mechanical transmitter, essentially just taking two equal opposite charges and fixing them to the opposite ends of a pole. Then you spin the pole around it's center (like a baton twirler) and it will emit some (mostly dipole) radiation.Take an identical setup and fix the centers of the two poles together so we have a cross and spin that in the plane of the cross (picture a tire iron), and we should have a decent quadrapole moment and thus some quadrapole radiation (supposing you could spin it fast enough).This made me consider iterations of this until you've a ring of alternating charges side by side spinning in a circle. Naturally I thought of table salt (some ionic crystal or another). So classically I get that it should radiate, but since it's a bound quantum state I'm not sure? Also, the strongest multipole moment I imagine would be some ridiculously large number for such a setup (probably making the radiation exceedingly weak and hard to detect?).Sorry no pictures or equations, I'm tiredAnyway, for those interested I was initially considering how the moment of inertia of our initial pole would end up being dependent upon rotation speed.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are \"equal opposite charges?\"\nWhat is a \"quadrapole moment?\"\nWhat is the strongest multipole moment?\nWhere would the emission of radiation be detectable?"}
{"prompt": "Doesn't expansion of space not allow a perputual motion? Well consider the following thought experiment: We have a tool to extract/transform \\\"nearly all\\\" potential gravitational energy into other forms of energy. We can theoretically make such an object (think about a very efficient sling, or a slide with minimal drag resistance). Now we can also consider a two body system one heavy central body and a smaller secondary body, which are initially at \\\"rest\\\" compared to each other. (gravitational potential stays equal). We can also have such an object theoretically.Now our system would at some \\\"point\\\" release the secondary body allowing it to \\\"fall\\reducing the gravitational energy and increasing its velocity (which could in some way be converted to other energy).This is all perfectly working in our classical system and doesn't violate any laws. We can get close to 100% efficiency theoretically. (unrealistic, sure but physically possible).However add the expansion of space to this system: and it becomes messy. On a small scale it still \\\"works\\however since gravity is a force that works without boundaries, the system should still work on the large scale.Say the two bodies are really far apart, gravity still works in this two body system and it will \\\"fall down\\\". Now we can deduce that space has increased between the bodies between us \\\"lifting it up there\\\" and \\\"releasing it\\\". Thus when it is at it's periapsis (or ground) the kinetic energy can be higher than the original energy put into the system.This additional energy could be \\\"removed\\\" before the object goes back up for another revolution. (and it would reach the original apoapsis again, but due to the time &amp; distance that again would be \\\"further away\\\").This would imply a perputual motion: of course it cannot work.Now there are a few things that make this impossible in practice, most notably we consider our universe nearly homogeneous, thus when we travel far away a two body system can no longer be consider a two body system as there is equal mass in every direction.However this would imply that expansion of space would only occur in systems where mass is homogenously distributed: an N-body system could never have expansion of space.Another idea is that space expansion only occurs between object not interacting with each other. (this fits the idea that exansion of space only works in big systems and not inside the solar system) But since gravity acts without bounds this can of course not be the case.So these can't be the reasons the above perputal motion system won't work: what am I missing? Other things could of course be that the gravitational constant changes when space changes (but that seems illogical with all other things I know). Or even that matter (mass) itself changes while space expands, but that also seems to alien and not in line with other experiences.I almost feel silly for considering a perpetual motion system, but one has to understand why it wouldn't work.

Plot Details/SummaryAs best as I can remember, the focus of the story is a planet that is in deep/interstellar space, balanced between the gravitational pulls of two distant star systems.  One of these is Sol, and I do not remember the other (Centauri or Proxima, perhaps?).  The planet's is comprised of a number of frozen chemical compounds that are able to exist in this form because of the planet's unique location.

Naturally occurring electrical impulses begin a process where, over the course of several millennia, simple chemicals develop into rudimentary circuits, which in turn become more sophisticated circuits, which eventually develops into a complex, planet-wide matrix.  In effect, the planet has become a massive organic supercomputer.Once the planet reaches the supercomputer stage, it develops an imperative to reach out and make contact.  The planet creates icy, comet-like \\\"probes\\\" which it launches into space in the direction of Sol system.  I'm not sure how these are launched.

{"prompt": "Area Under The Receiver Operating - incompatible explanations There is one thing which confuses me about two very common explanations regarding the interpretation of the Area Under The Receiver Operating Characteristic (referred to shortly as AUC). Concretely, these are1) The benchmark of 0.5 for a coin toss, i.e. that if a simple coin toss is determined as a \\\"test\\that in this case the AUC-value would be 0.5.2) That the AUC-value corresponds to the probability of correctly classifying two randomly individuals, one from each group (e.g. a person who has the disease a person who does not have the disease). For the matter of this post, the alternative explanation that, using normalized units, the AUC area under the curve is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative').What confuses me is the following thought: Suppose I use the coin-toss \\\"test\\\" and apply it two the two individuals from property 2.). This test has a probability of 0.5 for a false negative and 0.5 for a false positive. The probability that I classify a positive and a negative outcome correctly is thus 0.25 (Prob[no false negative for the positive indivudual] * Pr[no false positive for the negative individual]). In all other cases, the two scores/tests will be either equal or have results opposite to what is actually true (interpreting the test inversely as often suggested when the area is &lt;0.5 does not help either for the coin flip case). This seems to be at odds with statement 1).Of course, I could just pick one of the two individuals, test it, and assign it the outcome the test shows - which is correct in 50% of all cases - and assign the other individuals the opposite outcome. This would achieve an accuracy of 0.5 as described in 1) but it would not really be what is described in 2) since I am only testing one person (i.e., one person in the sample would not have a test-score). The two paragraphs of reasoning seem to contradict each other. Is any of them wrong, if yes where or is this really a paradox?*Note that I see that the coin toss would be under the diagonal and would get, together with other tests where the false-positive rate equals the true-positive rate, get an area of 0.5 under curve.

{"prompt": "Bidirectional effects? When testing relationships between variables, we are often trying to establish a finding that Variable A causes (or is connected with) an increase in Variable B, or that Variable A causes a decrease in Variable B, or that Variable A doesn't cause neither an increase nor a decrease in Variable B.However, I have a vague idea that effects of one variable on another variable can often be bidirectional. More specifically, I think that sometimes Variable A simultaneously causes both an increase and a decrease in Variable B. For example, how is the openness of the window related to the number of flies in the house? Suppose there are no flies in your house. If your window is open, some flies will fly into your home. After some time, they will fly out, but other flies will fly in. Perhaps the number of the flies will be constant over time because the fly in/fly out rate is stable. However, if we kept our window closed, the number of flies would be zero. This may lead us to believe that the openness of the window causes an increase in the number of flies. However, if the openness of the window is related just to the increase in the number of flies, then no flies would ever fly out of the house, but we know this is not true. My point is that the openness of the window causes an increase in the number of flies that fly in the house, but it also causes an increase in the number of flies that fly out of the house. Or, more simply, openness of the window is related both to the increase and the decrease in the number of flies in the house.I suspect a similar mechanism may be behind some confusing findings in the literature. For example, some studies link cannabis usage to increased cancer risk, while other studies link it to decreased cancer risk. What if cannabis simultaneously increases and decreases cancer risk? What I suspect most researchers would do is look for a moderator variable, so that they can say \\\"Cannabis increases cancer risk in those participants, but it decreases cancer risk in these participants\\\". However, I believe that this \\\"bidirectionality\\\" can arise in a standalone manner, with no moderator variables, like in the window/fly example.What are your thoughts on this topic?

They are universal estimators, over-fitting can be managed with dropout, l2 regularization, l1 regularization, batch-normalization. Training speed is not generally an issue if we have just 50,000 training examples. They are better at test time than, let us say, random forests.So why not - clean the data, impute missing values as you would generally do, center the data, standardize the data, throw it to an ensemble of neural networks with one hidden layer and apply regularization till you see no over-fitting and then train them to the end. No issues with gradient explosion or gradient vanishing since it is just a 2 layered network. If deep layers were needed, that means hierarchical features are to be learned and then other machine learning algorithms are no good as well. For example SVM is a neural network with hinge loss only. An example where some other machine learning algorithm would outperform a carefully regularized 2 layered (maybe 3?) neural network would be appreciated. You can give me the link to the problem and I would train the best neural network that I can and we can see if 2 layered or 3 layered neural networks falls short of any other benchmark machine learning algorithm.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is a neural network?\nWhat do \"neural networks vs everything else\" mean in the passage?\nWhat are the reasons that these other machine learning algorithms may outperform a carefully regularized 2 layered neural network?\nWhat are deep learning and machine learning?\nHow do neural networks function in different situations?\nWhat does overfitting mean and how can it be managed with various strategies?"}

It might seem obvious that the covariance is a \\\"deeper\\\" property of the data generation process (DGP), since normally the specification of a joint distribution is done in terms of its mean vector and covariance matrix. From these, the correlation structure can be deduced.

In fact, correlations are interesting enough in that they are bounded between -1 and 1 and are comparable. Thus, it is possible to see them somewhat as a more \\\"structural\\\" property of the data.

{"prompt": "Asteroid material that can cause signal distortion I'm making a hard-ish sci-fi universe where humans colonized nearby star systems and found not one but two civilizations in Alpha Centauri, each at home on a planet orbiting one of the two main stars.

{"prompt": "How to Train Your Mimic (or, why would a Mimic be capable of domestication) I'm making a world where I want domesticated Mimics to be a thing.These Mimics are pretty similar to the original concept of D&amp;D Mimics: shapeshifters that imitate objects, and hunt by imitating something desirable to their prey, then attacking when the prey comes close using a sticky secretion and a bludgeoning pseudopod.The questions I have are as follows: Why would a creature with this kind of lifestyle be trainable, let alone domesticatable?How might one go about domesticating and training them?Animals that humans have domesticated tend to have similar characteristics: social, active, and preferably herbivorous (with a few exceptions).  Mimics are none of these.I want them to be roughly similar to dogs in intelligence: not civilized creatures, but smart enough to learn and sociable enough to train for various diverse purposes (the most obvious being as house guards, but can also make good pets, can be used by hunters as decoys, and can even help the disabled using the versatility a tentacled shapeshifter has to offer).  As with dogs, they come in various different breeds that vary in size and disposition.The exact details of their evolutionary progress aren't important (they can be presumed to have evolved from an already existing class of amorphous muscular blobs) but they are a natural creature that evolved in a natural environment, without magic or human involvement (\\\"wild\\\" Mimics usually imitate plants or dead animals to lure their prey).  As such, their intelligence and disposition should make sense for a creature with their lifestyle to have.(Interestingly, D&amp;D does have a precedent for the occasional friendly Mimic and even talking Mimics, though these are rarely used.  But this is more for gameplay reasons and isn't really explained in a plausible manner.)The main goal is to design a creature that, while functionally a traditional shapeshifting Mimic, also has a plausible survival-based reason for having a \\\"domestication-friendly\\\" brain despite its solitary, ambush-predator hunting strategy.Additional details about these Mimics:Mimics are obligate carnivores.  Like snakes and crocodiles, they prefer large single meals over regular small ones, at least in the wild.While they can change their topography, color, and texture, and are capable of \\\"locking\\\" their muscles into place to remain stationary for long periods of time without expending excess energy, they are basically muscular blobs and can't really maintain a convincing shape while in motion (though they are capable of \\\"jiggling\\\" a part of their body to attract prey, and can form basic shapes like tentacles).  They also can't change their mass, though some cleverer ones can change their apparent volume by expanding hollow spaces inside their bodies.They are not good at moving quickly (the fastest they run is about the speed of a brisk human walk, and they don't like to do this often) but they can lash out with a pseudopod extremely fast, and they can climb walls using a combination of shapeshifting and their sticky glue.  House Mimics can be trained not to \\\"slime\\\" but this is difficult.Wild Mimics rarely prey on humans (not enough opportunity for the risk, and not enough overlap between the items humans go for and those that more common prey go for).  Most \\\"chest Mimics\\\" are domesticated Mimics who have been specifically trained to guard a house by imitating an object that a thief is likely to go for.  Some notorious Mimics have been known to target humans though; as with other \\\"man-eating\\\" animals they are usually hunted down and killed.They can see using any part of their body, but their \\\"eyes\\\" must be dark and smooth for them to see effectively.  This makes it difficult for them to disguise themselves perfectly and see at the same time.Mimics are not born knowing how to shapeshift, nor can they imitate an object perfectly on sight: they learn through experience and observation (usually by extending an \\\"eye\\\" on a pseudopod to look at themselves).  The more a Mimic has practiced a particular form, the quicker it is able to take that shape and the more accurate the imitation will be.  Young Mimics can take a few hours taking on a new form; more experienced ones can adopt a shape in seconds.Mimics can pass the mirror test, and learn much faster when they have a mirror available.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why would a creature with this kind of lifestyle be trainable, let alone domesticatable?\nHow might one go about domesticating and training them?\nAs with dogs, they come in various different breeds that vary in size and disposition.

{"prompt": "How can I erase all photos on my iOS 11 device that can't be removed with Image Capture trick? I have over 17,000 photos sync'd from my Mac on to my iPhone running iOS 11. As seems these days, the synced photos do not give you the option of deleting them from the phone (yes, I understand this wouldn't delete them from my Mac).

Photos that have been sync'd do not give the option to be deleted, that privilege only exists for those in the current Camera Roll. As well, the Image Capture trick suggested does not work because that method only addresses pictures in the Camera Roll; it does not see the sync'd photos.In the past, I should have been able to simply uncheck the \\\"Sync Photos\\\" box and accept the \\\"Remove from Phone\\\" button, sync and then see the photos disappear from the phone.

I've tried re-enabling and sync'ing with a subset of photos which appears to complete successfully, but then when I try to uncheck and \\\"Remove from Phone\\\" and sync again, they still don't delete.In the past you used to be able to go into the Settings app and under storage for Photos you could press a button to delete all photos from the phone; it doesn't appear to exist as an option anymore, only \\\"put everything on the cloud\\\" which is something I do NOT want to do. It just seems that iTunes sync doesn't try to remove the old photos like it doesn't understand that they're there.Is there any way to delete all the photos on my phone or do I have to completely wipe my phone and start all over again? Strangely, the last backup iTunes took of my phone was nearly 3 months ago and the button to manually do one is grayed out thus I'm a little hesitant to do the restore.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why was the Image Capture trick not working?\nHow would deleting the photos from the phone solve the problem of too many photos on the device?\nIs there a way to delete all photos from the device without wiping it and starting over?\nWhy did iTunes stop automatically removing old photos and syncing new ones?"}

{"prompt": "Is there a menu bar tool which will let me eject external drives easily? I usually have a lot of external drives connected to my MacBook, such as flash drives, hard drives, and SD cards. It so happens that I need to eject them quite often.The usual way I eject these is by either showing the desktop using a shortcut and dragging the drives I want to eject to the trash, or navigating to the finder and ejecting the drives from there, or by using a script which ejects all my external drives at once. However, when I want to do something simple like ejecting a flash drive or SD card (which I do quite often) I'd prefer not to break my workflow and simply be able to, say, click on a menu bar icon and select which volume I want to eject.I haven't yet seen a utility which can achieve this.

I'm not in this environment - I'm used to hard-wiring config changes and not have something mess with them.

{"prompt": "Stuck with install of dual-boot on \\u201cremove installation media\\u201d I am trying to install a dual-boot system on my windows computer (HP Spectre).  I have turned off secure boot and fast boot, partitioned my hard drive (I gave 100GB to Ubuntu) and created a USB Drive that was formatted to have the Ubuntu boot on it (I don\\u2019t have a DVD drive on my computer, so I have to use USB).  I used Rufus 3.1 to accomplish this.  I also changed my boot order to boot first to the USB HDD.When I boot up with the USB drive inserted, it boots to the GRUB Menu.  I have tried both \\\"Try Ubuntu\\\" and \\\"Install Ubuntu\\\".  Both bring me to an Ubuntu loading screen, and then to one that says \\u201cPlease remove the installation medium, then press ENTER\\u201d.  If I do not do anything, it will just stay there.  If remove the USB drive and press enter, it shuts down the computer.  If I DON\\u2019T remove the USB drive and just press enter, the same occurs.After the shutdown, I have tried to restart.  Restart without the USB drive loads Windows 10.  Restart with the USB drive brings me back to the GRUB startup screen.I have tried multiple USB ports and USB drives, so that is not the issue.  The computer is a 2018 model laptop with intel i7, 16GB RAM, and a SSD - power or RAM shouldn\\u2019t be a problem. I have also tried the \\u201ccheck for problems with the disk\\u201d option - it shows no issues. Heat is also not an issue - I tried this in the refrigerator and freezer, and it occurs no matter how hot or cool the computer runs.  At this point, I\\u2019m pretty much out of steps.  Has anyone had the same difficulty?  Does anyone know how to fix it?  Thanks.EDIT: I tried to follow all of the steps in the mentioned article, and it does not solve the problem.  The question fails to explain a working solution to the problem - instillation with the USB media stops at the stage mentioned above, and there\\u2019s is no way that I can find (including boot options menu) to get to the boot without the drive installed.  Also, even if I select the \\u201ctry Ubuntu\\u201d option, I get the same issue - I cannot get into a live Ubuntu Session beyond the Ubuntu loading screenEDIT #2:  I don't know what caused the problem, but I was able to fix through this process:When at the grub bootloader, select the \\\"try ubuntu\\\" option, and press \\\"e\\\" for edit command.  In the edit command screen, add acpi=off to the end of the first command.  That fixed it for me.\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "The article has not been updated in recent years, so why does the computer have issues booting with Ubuntu?\nIs this a RAM issue (because of the new process)?\nHow can the installer get out of the cycle of shutting down?\nWhy would the computer automatically shut down when it doesn't have sufficient power or memory?"}
