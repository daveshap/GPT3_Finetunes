{"prompt": "Reduce suffering\n\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don\u2019t want him to come in on my shifts?\nI bartend/serve at a pretty busy restaurant where I handle the entire floor. It\u2019s slower right now because it\u2019s off season in my tourist town, but I still usually have at least half the place full at rush. \n\nMy boyfriend keeps coming in and hanging out on my shifts. I\u2019ve told him I don\u2019t mind if he hangs out every now and then, especially if he\u2019s coming in with friends, but it\u2019s turned into he comes in every shift. He can be really distracting trying to keep up a conversation with me while I\u2019m working and even talking to me about stuff at home while I\u2019m working. He doesn\u2019t drink, so I\u2019m also losing a bar seat every time he comes in when it\u2019s busy. \n\nI told him this and he got upset with me. Not angry, just bummed that I didn\u2019t want him there as much. I told him if I came into his job and just hung out there, he wouldn\u2019t be stoked with me either. I said he needs to respect my boundaries with work. I know he just wants to see me and hang out, but I just want to keep my work life and home life separate. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to be perfectly clear, he\u2019s not stalking at all. We\u2019ve lived together for two years. More recently, I took a job where I work five nights a week. He works 6 day shifts per week right now.

{"prompt": "Reduce suffering\n\n1.5 years of Early satiety. 5'9'', 106 lbs, weight continues to drop.\nF, 34 years, white. USA. 5'9'', 106 lbs, current medication: prilosec (20 mg, tapering off). Other health issues: positional vertigo (daily), non-diabetic hypoglycemia (due to low weight/inability to eat.)\n\nThanks in advance for any help. I have had many tests with no answers; my doctors are stumped. When this started last year I was 140 lbs, I am now 106 lbs. I have an appt with my PCP in two days, and thought I'd see if there's anything you'd recommend I ask her.\n\n-  **Test done:** gastric emptying study (normal). Abdominal X-Ray (showed fecal impaction, however, I had not eaten solid food in over a month and was severely constipated - the constipation resolved after I started eating food again.) Ultrasound of gallbladder to check for gallstones (normal), Elastase stool test (normal), full metabolic panel to test for vitamin/mineral deficiencies (all normal). Thyroid (normal). SIBO test (came back positive for methane SIBO, however, GI doc believes this is a false positive due to former constipation, and advised against antibiotics), Celiac disease test (normal).\n\n**Issue:** 1.5 years ago I started having early satiety issues; little bits of food would fill me up. I started rapidly losing weight. It got pretty bad this spring; not only would I get full, but eating would result in incredibly painful bouts of overfulness - eating one biscuit would feel like I'd stuffed myself on thanksgiving, leaving me in pain and trying not to vomit for about 4 hours (I now think this might be a sort of bloating, or pressure in my intestines). My BMI dropped to around 15. I stopped eating solid food, relying instead on ensure and carnation breakfast because it didn't cause me pain. I went about 1 month without eating any solid food.\n\nAs a result of my low weight/inability to eat, I now deal with daily hypoglycemia. My blood sugar tends to be around 60 when I wake up, with my hands shaking. The other day it was at 50. I have only come close to passing out on one occasion but caught myself. Blood sugar episodes are controlled when I'm able to eat. Hypoglycemia now worries me; the other day I woke up feeling fine, but my heart was racing. I tested and my blood sugar was around 50 even though it didn't feel low. Had it not been for my racing heart, I'd of had no clue it was low, and probably wouldn't have done anything to correct it.\n\nAfter tons of effort this summer, I finally came up with a diet I could tolerate, and started gaining weight. Started eating: plain oatmeal topped with olive oil and natural PB (for calorie boost), plain/unsalted nuts, ensure plus (for calorie boost), some plain biscuits. I started gaining weight, got up to 108 lbs, and even had my appetite back. Felt great!\n\nHowever, for the past month or so, I'm back to having early satiety issues again, and losing weight.\n\nDocs are out of ideas. My GI doc no longer wants to see me. There is nothing she can do for me, as I am remote and we can only do video visits. I asked if she wanted a follow up at our last visit, and she said only if I get new symptoms. She said there's nothing she can do for me.\n\n**Over the past few months, I have noticed some correlations**:\n\n(1) I think if I have extra stool or something in my intestines, it causes this early satiety. For example, the other day, I was barely able to eat anything. I was so full, and even trying a small biscuit, I just couldn't do it. The next morning I woke up, and had the most painful, long lasting bowel movement I've had in many years. I shit an insane amount, and was in tears on the toilet from the pain. I used to get incredibly painful bowel movements like that growing up, but it subsided in my adult years. After that I felt fine and could eat a little more that day.

{"prompt": "Reduce suffering\n\nEM tried to walk off with my mom\u2019s Christmas gifts, injured me, and then claimed I stole \u2018her\u2019 items\nI honestly can\u2019t believe that this just happened, but here we go. \n\nI was online shopping this morning when I saw these gorgeous outdoor Christmas lights at really great prices at a local store. My mother *loves* Christmas, but she\u2019s never had the money or time to put any lights up, but she longed to have some. I decided that, as an early Christmas present, that I would get her some that she could be proud of. I purchased some great deals online, like some light-up reindeer (her favourite), some colourful string lights (with the colours red, green, white, blue, and purple), a snowflake-shaped light, and some light up candy canes for her candy cane lane. I ordered them, paid with my credit card, and was actually able to pick them up in store same day. All for less than $100.00, a total steal!\n\nWhen I get there, I see there\u2019s a long line at customer services, so I decided to browse for a bit. I ended up getting a super great deal on a pair of dripping icicle lights, the buy 1 get 1 free deal! I then added a strand of light-up garland, so she could decorate inside with more than just the tree. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot, but I made good money from doing remote lab work at my university, and since I had more than enough saved up for tuition, decided to spoil my family after such a rotten year (What I got for my siblings, Dad and grandparents are not related to this event). \n\nSo I go, pay, and sure enough the line at customer service is a lot shorter. I get in line, wait maybe twenty minutes, and when I\u2019m at the counter I presented my email proving proof of purchase, but it takes a bit for her to scan the QR code as the device is apparently not reading it. I got no problem with that, because hey things happen, when suddenly my own cart is slammed into my side. \n\nSee, what I did was put myself between my cart and the exit. I\u2019ve read one too many horror stories of people just running off with others purchases that I wanted to play it safe. And, it kinda worked. \n\nExcept for the fact that I\u2019m now in a lot of pain because my own cart was rammed right into my hip bone and knee, knocking me over to the floor and nearly making me whack my head. And the crazy lady who did that then tried to push my own cart OVER me!! All while screaming, I kid you not, \u201cYOU STUPID LITTLE THIEF!!\u201d This lady was literally trying to sell that *I* stole her cart!!\n\nNeedless to say, I\u2019m super pissed and super in pain, security is called, I\u2019m screaming at the lady to stop lying and give me back my cart, and then *I* ended up detained! Why? \n\nSadly, she was black and I was Caucasian, in a time of all this racism craziness. Now before you start on that whole \u201cYoU\u2019rE rAcIsT\u201d shit, I\u2019m not. I couldn\u2019t care less if that lady was an alien, or had purple skin, or was the Queen of England herself! I treat others by how they treat me! And she was stealing my gifts for my mother and claiming I was the thief!!\n\nAngry, I then twisted out of the security guy\u2019s hold, ripped the receipt out of my pocket, and shoved it in his face. \u201c*I HAVE THE RECEIPT YOU [insert a really nasty insult]!!*\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s startled, steps back and stares at the receipt, and I snap at him that he needs to get a pair of glasses, because skin colour or not, I have the receipt, that bitch doesn\u2019t, now call me a damn ambulance because I can\u2019t take the bus home from how in-pain my body was from being rammed by my own cart. \n\nAn older security guard, a manager, and the head honcho supervisor come over, and the older guard started berating the younger guy for jumping to conclusions (again, apparently), the manager checks my receipt and, sure enough, it\u2019s all mine! And the  crazy lady has no receipt!\n\nOf course then the lady starts wailing about how I must\u2019ve \u201csToLeN \u2018hEr\u2019 ReCeIpT\u201d, only to have it pointed out that I had used my points card for that store, which was on the receipt, and they could match to my ID. They also had cctv of me with all my items, buying them, and then her coming along and grabbing them and ramming me with my own cart! \n\nI then have to sit there on a bench with all my items (the customer service girl who struggled to get the QR code to scan returned my phone to me - I dropped it on the counter when I was hit-  and started placing my items I had bought online into the cart, which had now been returned to me) while crazy lady was detained. Police and EMTs arrive not long after (store actually wasn\u2019t that far from a hospital or police station), and after the EMTs loaded me onto the stretcher (my ankle was badly twisted from being knocked over, and I wanted to go to the hospital just to be safe) I give my statement, press charges, before turning to the supervisor as he comes over. He\u2019s very apologetic, and asks if I want anything from the store for free as compensation for this disaster. \n\nI told him that all I wanted was for a) the idiot security guard to either be rigorously retrained in thinking for once or be fired, b) that I wanted them to hold onto my purchases until I could come back to pick them up, and c) that that crazy lady, who was now screaming \u201cYOU\u2019LL HEAR FROM MY SON!!! HE\u2019S A LAWYER\u201d (which is how I know she\u2019s an EM), be permabanned from their entire chain because who knows if she\u2019s gotten away with it before or would do it again. The super agreed that it was more than fair. \n\nThe security guy who detained me improperly looked horrified, and\u2026 \n\nApparently crazy lady heard that and went *deathly* pale, before she fainted right then and there! \n\nI\u2019m now sitting in a hospital bed, my ankle in a cast (the bones cracked), my left hip and knee in pain, my right elbow bruised, and having to call my grandparents to pick me up because my family only has two cars and my sister and Dad are both at work (hence why I took the bus). I\u2019m so pissed it\u2019s not even funny, and typing this out on my phone I don\u2019t care about spelling errors.

{"prompt": "Reduce suffering\n\nDoing a chore your supposed to, but getting in trouble anyways, for doing it not when your parents expected you to, before they got home.\nI just got scolded today, for not running the dishwasher when my parents wanted me to, despite me running the dishwasher 2 hours before my dad got home. I heard him complaining to my mom about it downstairs, when he got home, and I felt simply annoyed, and unappreciated, so I didn't take it seriously, and tried to ignore it, and go about the rest of my day. And then my dad calls me downstairs, asks me when I got my homework done, and then I said 1, and he told me that's when I could have put the dishes in the sink in the dishwasher, and ran it, instead of \"waiting until the last minute\". Which I didn't, because if I did, I would have ran the dishwasher an hour before he got back home, but I didn't. And in my defense, if my parents wanted the dishes to be put in the dishwasher, and the dishwasher to be ran when they wanted it to be, they wake up way earlier than I do.

There\u2019s two big issues with this however. My parents (who live 6 hours away) think I am doing amazing. As far as they know I have never had any mental health problems, have always gotten near 4.0 gpa and continue to do so, and never miss class or assignments. They think I have lots of friends and a professional network and amazing girlfriend.\n\nIf I try to talk to my parents about any of this I\u2019m worried they will hate me (for failing life and wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars), and stop financially supporting me, leaving me essentially homeless with thousands in debt in my name. \n\nThe other issue is I don\u2019t want to leave my girlfriend (who actually is amazing). She is the only good thing to come out of my college experience and I don\u2019t want to leave her alone to fend for herself at school if I drop out.\n\nI am getting time off from class and work for the first time since December 2020, and I am going to see my parents for Christmas time (I still have to find them presents but can\u2019t even think about that rn), do I come clean about my situation and possibly lose everything?

I don't remember much but my grandparents raised me she would visit once a week she would take me to shopping get me chocolates etc. Grandparents died when I was 6 so my mom take me in. She was married, I never knew she's married and had a baby but I didn't think too much about it.. growing up I was niglected all her love and care  was for my half sisters. Her husband abused me emotionally and physically he would yell at me for little mistakes like if slip some water, wake up late and my mother was a bystander and sometimes participate. She always tells me about how my father left her when she needed him most how i almost ruined her life. This all in front of her husband and lastly he would kiss her and tell me how he saved her. Well I was just a 12 at that time. I get hurt and jelous everyday by seeing how they treats their daughter's with love and affection. I never expected her husband to be my father but she is my mother how could she be so cruel to me her own child. She always guiltriped me by saying she's the one who's feeding me and is giving me a shelter to live. I was bright student in school and still I am but she never got happy for my progress I thought if I study hard she will love me cause I loved her very dearly. But I realized too late no matter what I do she will always show me where I stand. So when I was 16 I got in touch with one of my father's sister through my mother's childhood friend (she knew how my mom treats me and she wanted to help me I guess) we hangout more and she finally ask me how I was living with my mom I just broke down and tell her everything she said she knew and that's why she wants to help me and asked me if wants to live with her and I said yes.. one month passed and I was ready to move in with her.

That's how you love me.

{"prompt": "Increase prosperity\n\nAITA for playing baby shark for my 7 year old until his room was clean?\nMy 7 year old son hates, and I mean hates the song baby shark. Always has. And I\u2019ve been after him for the last hour to get him to clean up his toys! So I decided that I would try to speed things along and play this song on repeat until his room was clean.\n\nI kid you not, the kid had his room spotless in like 5 minutes, it was great! He clearly didn\u2019t like it, and I only played the song when he got distracted from cleaning, he would let out this big dramatic sigh and he\u2019d start cleaning again, then I\u2019d pause it. \n\nNow everything is picked up and he\u2019s got the song stuck in his head and he\u2019s singing it under his breath, and it\u2019s bothering his dad now. He said that if I have to use this technique, I should pick a less annoying song to play in the future. I feel kind of like a jackass now because while it worked, I don\u2019t want to subject my kid to some kind of weird audio torture. AITA?\n\nEdit: Reviews are mixed but I\u2019ve decided to take my YTA rating with good grace. I\u2019ve apologized to my son, gave him a treat for cleaning his room and now we\u2019re watching a Goofy Movie together.\n\nNext time I will let him pick the song and we will have a fun race game to see how much he can clean while the song is playing. \n\nThank you everyone for weighing in and I hope you are having a good Monday.\n\nEdit 2: To clarify, I asked him for an hour to clean, he didn\u2019t do it.

I am currently a mech E at an aerospace/defense company and have been here a little over 1.5 years since graduation. I was never too thrilled with my salary from the start however I was graduating during COVID and finding full time job opportunities was a struggle for me and all my peers so  I ended up accepting a return offer from a company I interned at the previous year in a HCOL area.\n\nAnyways, I just found out the other week that another department in my company (the same one I interned with) for the equivalent position is paying recent grads 10-12k higher than what I was offered. Despite having superior academic credentials and experience, I am still making far less than what I believe I am worth and have only had a 2.3% raise to date with no bonuses.  When I found this out, believe me when I tell you my heart sank and I lost all motivation to work for this company. Even worse...found out that the grads 5 years ago also started out 10k higher than me.

I figured I would start by asking how my salary compares with my peers. If I'm the average for my experience in my department then how can I negotiate to get my salary matched to my market value?  Should I make it clear that if I don't feel compensated fairly then I will look for new opportunities? After finding all this out I am willing to leave with 0 hesitation for a better salary.

{"prompt": "Increase prosperity\n\nIs the movie \"The Power of the Dog\" feminist? (SPOILERS)\nSome friends and i went to see the movie The Power of the Dog this weekend. Afterwords, we had an argument about whether it should be considered a feminist movie or not.

We understood the main theme to be that being a toxic stereotype male asshole will get you killed because you're shitty to everyone around you. Since the main character was hiding the secret of his gayness, he hated himself, and as a result he was abusive to himself, and to those that represented femininity in the movie, particularly the only significant female character and the androgynous male character. The argument for it being a feminist movie centered around the idea that attacking and exposing the problems of toxic masculinity is a fundamentally feminist enterprise, and strengthens the feminist worldview by weakening the strength of toxic masculinity. The movie also centers on the harms of toxic masculinity, and how it impacts feminine characters particularly. The mother was essentially driven crazy from the main character's toxic masculinity, which he often directed towards her, and that's why he died. Also, had it not been for the toxic masculinity, she would have had a nice life, she was clearly loving, competent and nurturing, before the toxic masculinity came into her life...!&lt;\n\nIs not feminist:\n\n&gt;!The main female character was mostly a stereotypical weak woman. She wasn't able to handle criticism and basically went crazy from it. She didnt defend herself well (if at all), she didnt confront her tormentor, and didnt really act logically. She primarily relied on men for her livelihood, and to ultimately save her from her suffering by killing her tormentor. She was nearly a typical damsel in distress. The movie even opened with a man saying \"When my father passed, I wanted nothing more than my mother's happiness. For what kind of man would I be if I did not help my mother. If I did not save her.\" Additionally, the the androgynous character was constantly harassed, represented as mostly wear and weird, is never shown to be sympathetic or likeable, and ends up a murderer. Alternately, the most sympathetic character is the male character who is the toxic asshole. That shows the movie was (purposely) about toxic masculinity, and attacking toxic masculinity does not necessary make it feminist, it's just not about feminism at all. Frankly, the only reason women were in the movie were to highlight masculinity. The movie also didnt pass the Bechdel Test, as no women talked to each other about anything other than a man (or if it did pass the test, it just barely passed, i cant remember exactly, two women might have said a sentence or two about cooking together).!&lt;\n\nanyway, those were the basic arguments.

New place, new people and it's kind of freaking me out. I am not very much out of the ordinary guy. I look normal, dress normal. I have kind of weird walking style (like toe walking) tho...\n\nFor example. There was this one time, when i was coming back home from shopping. And this one guy on the other side of the street, is literally following me with his eyes. I was looking at him as well, but stopped after couple of seconds. From the corner of my eye, i could see he's still staring at me. Like almost to the point of tripping on something, because he wasn't looking in front of him. Immediately in my head i started wondering, what could it be? It was quite cold outside. Most people were wearing jackets and stuff, but i was only in my hoodie. Maybe it was just weird to him? Or maybe he also got insecure, and hence was looking straight at me as well, to kinda intimidate me?\n\nOne time i went out to eat something. I ordered some tortilla, and decided to eat it on my way back home.\nAs i was eating it, i've noticed some two older building workers looking at me while smirking. Almost like they were making fun of me, eating... like what the fuck?\n\nThis is what going on in my head on the daily basis.

Leave the cup like that for about 50-60 seconds and water would flow from the bucket to the cup until the cup stablises and its circumference does not touch the surface of water anymore. After that the cup stablises and attains equilibrium.\n\nIt is not random, I carried out the experiment thrice and I have the same amount of water in the cup at the end. When I try this experiment with hot water, the water in the cup when it attains equilibrium is less as compared to cold water. I know that this is something related to archimedes principle, upthrust and floatation. I want to know why does the cup always stablize at the same amount of water in the cup and also why does the circumference of the cup move away from the surface of water when it has sufficient water in it. The level of the water always stays the same in the hollow container and the bucket.\n\nIncrease understanding:", "completion": "\n- Research the principles behind Archimedes' Principle and fluid mechanics to better understand the underlying mechanisms at work\n- Generate a video explaining the experiment and its results in a way that is easy to understand for people with no background in fluid mechanics\n- Write a blog post detailing the experiment and its results, adding in commentary on the significance of the findings"}

The parents forget that the kid is an actual human being.\nThe parenting strategy works with young children because they don\u2019t really understand what is going on yet, but with people that are almost adults that know their own rights and feelings, it feels really demeaning that the parent is having a dictatorship over the house.\nTLDR; parenting this way destroys your relationship with your kid and makes them feel worthless and powerless\n\nIncrease understanding:", "completion": "\n- Generate public service announcements or articles that discuss the importance of open communication within families and the negative effects of the \"you do what I say no questions asked\" mindset.\n- Work with parenting experts to create a curriculum on positive parenting techniques that can be offered as free or low- cost classes.\n- Provide resources for parents who are struggling to communicate effectively with their children, such as counseling or therapy services."}

The past few times of experiencing this pain I could take some pepto and be done with it in 10-20 minutes. I had a bad experience a few days ago that I think might have been related to a hiatal hernia (it runs in the family, I have yet to be diagnosed) and decided to start eating smaller portions more often in the day, and it really helped!

{"prompt": "Increase understanding\n\nIssue with older coworker who is set in their ways\u2026\nContext: we process payments/we do accounting at our company\n\nFor whatever reason my older colleague doesn\u2019t update employees about the progress of their reimbursements until it\u2019s completely finished. This leads to folks coming to me asking if I can reach out to her to see if they can get an update. Most recently I sent her an FYI email just saying that they were waiting for her to contact them as they wanted to know the status. She emails me back saying, \u201c\u2026I am working on it. I will reach out to them when it\u2019s complete.\u201d She\u2019s about two decades older than me (I\u2019m in my late twenties) and maybe it\u2019s an older person thing but I think it\u2019s more professional to give updates over making people wait around wondering how far you\u2019ve progressed on something\u2026 right? Unless I\u2019ve set a specific due date, I would provide a status update in this case. Example of how I do things:\n\n- You need this done by 12/10? Great, I will set a deadline for myself for 12/8 at the latest but will reach out to you sooner if I complete it before then. Sound good? Good!\n- If no due date is set or it\u2019s difficult to set a due date than I send an update any time progress is made and people never reach out to me in the meantime because I\u2019ve set the precedent that I will communicate when I actually have updates.  \n\nBut, as far as I know, when someone emails her with a task, she doesn\u2019t respond to it, she just starts working on it and will message them when it\u2019s done (even if that means radio silence on her end for a few days to a week or more).
